                        content: `It is important to define the term ‘rukn’ at the outset. Linguistically speaking, rukn denotes the mainstay of something which provides it with strong support.This is why it is often referred to as ‘pillar’.  In an Islamic context, rukn is a part of something that is essential for its completion. Thus both the rukn and the condition are essential for something to take place, but a condition is not part of that something, while a rukn is.
        
                        ‘Bowing’, or ruku', is a rukn of prayer, because it is a part of it and its omission renders the prayer invalid, while ablution, or wudu’, is a condition, because it is essential for the validity of prayer but is not a part of it.[1]
                        
                        
                        To re-emphasize, both rukn and condition are essential for the validity of prayer, but they differ in the following ways:
                        
                        1. Conditions take place before the prayer, while rukns are within it;
                        
                        2. Conditions start before a prayer and continue until it has finished, while rukns are temporary, with one yielding to the next. Each of the following consecutive acts is a rukn of prayer: standing up, bowing, standing up again, prostration, rising, etc.
                        
                        3. The combination of all rukns constitute the prayer, but this is not so with the conditions. To cover up certain parts of the worshipper’s body is a condition but it forms no part of the prayer.[2]`
                    },
                    {
                        id: 2,
                        name: `The first rukn: the declaration`,
                        content: `I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of being worshipped other than Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is Allah’s messenger.’ This declaration testifying to two important facts is the gateway to Islam. It is indeed the most essential aspect of Islam. No one is considered a Muslim unless he or she makes this declaration. Once it is said by disbeliever, he becomes a Muslim.[1]
        
                        What the declaration means
                        
                        The first part, ‘There is no deity worthy of being worshiped other than Allah’, means that no one may be rightly worshipped except Allah, the Glorious, the Most High. This part includes two essential elements: a negation and a confirmation. It negates “worthiness of being worshipped” of anyone other than Allah, and it confirms that divinity belongs to Him alone, without partners. It implies disbelief in all that was ever worshipped other than Allah, whether they were human, animate or inanimate objects. It further implies the disavowal of any such worshipped person or object and hating these. 
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘And Your god is  one God, There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful’
                        
                        (2:163)
                        
                        ‘There shall be no compulsion in religion. The right way is henceforth distinct from error. He who rejects false deities and believes in Allah has indeed taken hold of a most firm support that never breaks. Allah hears all and knows all’
                        
                        (2: 256)
                        
                        The Arabic word ilah, , i.e. deity, means ‘the God who is rightfully worshipped’. A person who believes that Allah is the Creator and Provider, or that He is the One able to accomplish everything, thinking that this is sufficient without believing that to Him alone all worship should be addressed and offered, benefits nothing by stating the first part of the declaration. In this case, stating that ‘there is no deity other than Allah’ does not bring him into the fold of Islam in this life and will not save him from Allah’s punishment in the life to come.[2]
            
                        
                         ‘Say:Who is it that provides for you from heaven and earth? Or, who is it that has power over hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living out of that which is dead, and brings forth the dead out of that which is alive? Who regulates all affairs?” They will say: “Allah.” Say, then: “Will you not, then, fear Him’ (10:31)
                        
                        ‘Yet if you ask them who created them they are sure to answer, “Allah.” How is it, then, that they are so misled?’ (43:87)
                        
                        ‘There is no deity other than Allah,’ is a great statement, because it makes clear that Allah is one, and this is the essence of Allah’s oneness which was the issue of contention between all Prophets (peace be upon them all) and their communities. Indeed all messengers were sent to establish Allah’s oneness in human life. 
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘Indeed, We have raised a messenger in every community, [who said to them]: “Worship Allah and shun all that is falsely worshipped.”’
                        
                        (16:36)
                        
                         ‘Before your time We never sent a messenger without having revealed to him that there is no deity other than Me. Therefore, you shall worship Me alone(21:25)
                        
                         When we speak ofAllah’s oneness, or tawhid, we are indeed implying all this.[3]
                        
                        The second part, ‘Muhammad is Allah’s messenger’, means that we are required ‘to obey all his orders, believe whatever he stated, refrain from everything he prohibited and to worship Allah according to the way he taught.’[4] This part of the declaration is implemented by fully believing that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was Allah’s servant and messenger, whom Allah sent to all mankind and jinn as His last Prophet and messenger. He was a human servant of Allah to whom Allah assigned a high position. It further means that all his commands must be respected and observed in word, action and belief.
                        
                        : Allah says
                        
                        ‘Say: “Mankind, I am indeed Allah’s messenger to you all’ (7:158)
                        
                        ‘And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, But most of the people do not know’ (34:28)
                        
                        ‘Muhammad is not the father of any one of your men, but is Allah’s messenger and the seal of all Prophets’ (33:40)
                        
                        ‘Say, "Exalted is my Lord! Was I ever but a human messenger’ (17:93)
                        
                        1. An acknowledgment of Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him)  message and believing in it;
                        
                        2. Declaring this belief verbally; 
                        
                        3. The practical implementation of the truth he delivered and refraining from all that he prohibited; 
                        
                        4. Believing in all that he stated; 
                        
                        5. Loving him more than one loves oneself, one’s property, offspring, parents and anyone else, because he is Allah’s messenger. As such, to love him is part of loving Allah. To love him truly is to follow him, implementing his orders and refraining from what he prohibited, and to support him and his cause; 
                        
                        6. Following his Sunnah, giving priority to whatever he said, accepting it and happily implementing his code.
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.’ 
                        
                        (4:65)
                        
                        The importance of the declaration
                        
                        The declaration confirming belief in Allah’s oneness and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as Allah’s messenger is of great importance. This is made clear in numerous Qur’anic and Hadith statements. What proves its importance includes:
                        
                        • That it is the first rukn of Islam, providing the essence of faith and religion. It is what brings a person into the faith of Islam, and it is the basis upon which the heavens and earth are set aright. 
                        
                        • It is the best action any person ever does, and it is the one thing that ensures the forgiveness of sins. It is a cause for admission into heaven and being safe from hell. To understand its true value one should realize that it is weightier in Allah’s scales than the heavens and the earth put together. Imam Muslim relates on 'Ubadah’s authority: ‘Whoever bears witness that there is no deity other than Allah and that Muhammad is Allah’s servant and messenger, Allah will prevent the Fire of hell from touching him.’ 
                        
                        • It combines Allah’s glorification with supplication and praise. It includes a supplication of worship and a supplication of request. It is the one glorification of Allah that is easiest to say. It is the good word, the firmest of ties and the statement that indicates purity of faith. It is the tenet by which the heavens and earth are set aright, and for which creation has taken place, messengers were sent by Allah and divine revelations were vouchsafed to them. To put effect to it acts of worship, both obligatory and recommended, have been outlined and jihad has been permitted. Whoever makes this declaration and acts upon it with true intention, sincerity and love will be admitted by Allah into heaven.`

                        Status of one who does not pray
                        Whoever does not offer prayers, denying it as an obligation, is, in effect, a disbeliever and such deliberate negligence places the one who is guilty of it outside the Islamic faith. Such a person is an apostate, rejecting Islam altogether, because he or she disobeys Allah, neglecting what Allah has made obligatory. Such a person is instructed to repent and mend his ways. If he does not, he becomes an apostate. As such, his body is not washed when he dies, the funeral  prayer for the deceased is not offered for him and he must not be buried in Muslims’ graveyards because he does not belong to them.

                        content: `Definition: Linguistically speaking, zakat means growth and increase. It also refers to praise, cleansing and good behaviour. Hence, the money paid out of one’s assets is called zakat because Allah blesses one’s property as a result, leading to its growth, and the person paying zakat is cleansed as Allah forgives him his sins.[1] In an Islamic context, zakat means a duty paid out of certain types of property, by certain people, to one of the eight specified categories mentioned in 9:60 at a specific time.[2]

Importance: Zakat is one of the five pillars upon which the structure of Islam is built.

:It is often mentioned in the Qur’an alongside prayer, as in

 ‘Establish prayer, pay your obligatory charity .i.e. zakat..’

(73:20)

‘And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and  to establish prayer and to give zakah’ 

(98:5)

:The Prophet (peace be upon him) said

‘Islam has been built on five pillars: testifying that there is no deity but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah’s messenger, performing the prayers, paying the zakat, making the pilgrimage to the House, and fasting in Ramadan’

(Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim)


Allah has made zakat obligatory so that it cleanses people’s hearts of greed and miserliness, provides help for the poor and the needy, ensures the growth of people’s property and gives it Allah’s blessing. Needless to say, all this helps to combat corruption, serve public interests and bring happiness to the community.

Allah states the purpose of zakat in the Qur’an as He instructs His messenger in the following terms:

‘Take, [O, Muhammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase’

(9:103)


Status: Zakat is obligatory to every Muslim who owns more than its threshold. There are certain conditions that apply to various types of property. It is obligatory even to a child and an insane person who meet its conditions. In this case their guardians are responsible to pay their zakat on their behalf. A person who knowingly denies its obligation is deemed an unbeliever, but the one who does not pay it out of negligence or stinginess commits a major sin. Zakat is collected from him by the force of law and he is liable to punishment for incurring a sin. Should he die in such a condition his fate is left to Allah, who may or may not forgive him.

:Allah says

‘Allah will never forgive that partners are associated with Him. He forgives any lesser sin to whomever He wills’

(4:48)


A stern warning is given in the Qur’an to those who do not pay their zakat, as Allah says:

‘To those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend them in Allah’s cause, give the news of a painful suffering, on the day when it will all be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads, sides and backs will be branded with them. [They will be told]: “This is what you have hoarded up for yourselves. Taste, then, what you have been hoarding”’

(9:34-35)

: Abu Hurayrah quotes the Prophet (peace be upon him) as saying

‘Anyone with hoarded property for which he does not pay zakat shall have his property heated in the fire of hell and made into [burning metal] sheets so as to brand his forehead and sides. Allah will then judge His creatures on a day the length of which is equal to 50,000 years. He will subsequently find his way to either heaven or hell,,,’`

                        Fasting in Ramadan was made obligatory to all Muslims during the second year of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) migration to Madinah. The Muslim community is in unanimous agreement that fasting in Ramadan is obligatory and that it is one of the pillars of Islam that are essentially known to all. Anyone who denies its obligation is an apostate unbeliever. We note that this obligation is confirmed in the Qur’an, the Sunnah and by unanimous agreement. Indeed all Muslims agree that whoever denies this obligation is an unbeliever.

These apply to all that a person does including prayer, fasting, zakat, commercial transactions such as selling, hiring, letting, gifting or mortgaging, killing, theft, jihad, etc.

                        content: `One: Textual sources

                        1-The Qur’an. It embodies the Islamic faith and the revelation that explains the faith Allah wants all people, in all ages, to adopt. It is indeed the first resort to which a scholar must refer when considering a ruling on any question. It is equally applicable to all people in all generations. Allah commands people to follow and implement His rulings of permission and prohibition outlined in the Qur’an.
                        
                        :He says
                        
                        ‘Follow, , what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow other than Him any allies.’
                        
                        (7:3)
                        
                        2-The Sunnah. This is the second source of Islamic legislation, ranking next to the Qur’an. It is defined as ‘everything authentically reported to have been said, done or approved by the Prophet (peace be upon him)’. Scholars are unanimous that the Sunnah is binding and serves as a source of legislation. It is unanimously agreed that the Sunnah must be implemented provided that its authenticity is established and it is not exclusive to the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself. Its verdicts of permissibility and prohibition are equally valid as the Quran.
                        
                        Two: Sources requiring scholarly endeavour (i.e. ijtihad)
                        
                        1-Unanimity (i.e. Ijma'): This means the consensus by all scholars who are qualified to exercise ijtihad, i.e. scholarly endeavour, in any particular period after the era of Prophethood, to arrive at a practical ruling.
                        
                        2- Analogy (i.e. Qiyas): This means applying the ruling specified by a religious text on a certain matter to another matter for which no text refers, provided that the same reasoning applies to both of them. 
                        
                        3-Subtle analogy (i.e. Istihsan): Discarding the verdict of a clear analogy in preference of a subtle one, or discarding a universal verdict in preference of a peculiar one, provided that such a process is based on firm evidence.
                        
                        4- Interests without rulings (i.e. Masalih Mursalah): This refers to matters that bring benefit to people but there is no religious evidence that approves or disapproves of them. Nor are there cases to which they may be compared in order to arrive at rulings concerning them through analogy. However, a ruling on such a matter is important because it brings some benefit or prevents some harm, which is the ultimate aim of Islamic law.
                        
                        5- Customs of Muslims (i.e. al- 'Urf): This refers to what people traditionally do or say and is not contrary to any religious text. Tradition and habit, which means something repeatedly done, signify the same thing, and they apply to speech and deeds.
                        
                        6- Statements by the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions’: A statement by a Companion of the Prophet (peace be upon him) relating to something that cannot be determined by reasoning or research, such as essential religious matters and worship practices, is accepted as valid. It is considered to have been learnt directly from the Prophet (peace be upon him). Hence, scholars consider such a statement as a hadith with a chain of transmission going up to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companion, without being expressly attributed to the Prophet(peace be upon him). As such, it is part of the Sunnah, although it appears to be a Companion’s view.
                        
                        7- The laws of earlier divine religions: This refers to legislation given by Allah to past communities through their own Prophets (peace be upon them all). Muslim scholars have studied such laws and whether they apply to us or not.
                        
                        8- Prevention of what leads to the prohibited (i.e. sadd al-dhara’i'): This aims to prohibit any means that leads to something forbidden that involves harm. According to scholars of Fiqh methodology dhara’i' means whatever is done in order to facilitate doing something forbidden that involves causing harm. What facilitates something forbidden is forbidden, just like what facilitates something obligatory is obligatory. 
                        
                        9- Al-Istishab: This means giving something its original ruling, as it was recognized, unless there is evidence confirming that this original ruling has been subject to change. Alternatively, it may be defined as considering the original ruling continuing for the present and the future until something appears to change it based on evidence. In essence, what was established in the past should normally remain valid for the future.

                        Imam al-Nu'man ibn Thabit, more widely known by his nickname Abu Hanifah, was born in Kufah, Iraq, in 80 AH/700 CE. He was of Persian origin, but Arab by birth and upbringing, and belonged to a rich and very religious family.
                        
                        He memorized the Qur’an at a young age, learning its recitation under  'Asim ibn Abi al-Nujud of Kufah, who was one of the best known reciters of the Qur’an. He frequented the circles of a large number of Kufah scholars, from whom he learned about Fiqh and Hadith.
                        
                        In the beginning, he was interested in scholastic theology, but he did not pursue that branch for long, turning his attention to Hadith and Fiqh. He learned the Hadith under  'Ata’ ibn Abi Rabah and Nafi', the disciple of  'Abdullah ibn  'Umar. His main teacher was Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman, and he continued to attend him until he passed away. Following the death of Hammad, after having spent 18 years with him, Abu Hanifah replaced his teacher. He was 40 at the time.
                        
                        Abu Hanifah then started to explain his methodology of arriving at rulings for different questions, and his approach to Fiqh. His views gained acceptance and he secured wide popularity.
                        
                        It should be made clear that Abu Hanifah learned from a large number of leading scholars. He is best known as the leading scholar of the school that gives prominence to personal reasoning, and he was the main Fiqh scholar in Iraq. Imam al-Shafi'i said of him: ‘In Fiqh, all of us are indebted to Abu Hanifah.’ Abu Hanifah died in 150 AH (768 CE).
                        
                        Methodology of the Hanafi school
                        
                        Explaining his methodology of arriving at rulings, Abu Hanifah said: ‘I refer first of all to Allah’s book, the Qur’an. If I do not find in it what is applicable, I refer to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Sunnah and the authentic reports of his guidance that are well known. If I find nothing in either Allah’s book or the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Sunnah, I refer to his companions, taking the view of whomever I prefer and leaving aside others, but I would never discard all their views in preference to anyone else’s view. If I find nothing and the matter is left to people like Ibrahim and al-Sha'bi, (naming a few others), I look into the question myself, just like they did.’

                        name: 'Imam Malik ibn Anas',
                        content: `Malik ibn Anas ibn Malik (93–179 AH/712–794 CE) was born in Madinah in the same year the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companion Anas ibn Malik died. He spent all his life there, and was very devout, intelligent and courageous. He would not hesitate to express his views, fearing nothing, which led to him being severely punished and flogged in later life, due to his verdict that divorce under duress is invalid. The torture he was subjected to resulted in dislocation of his arm and caused him to suffer from incontinence until he died.


                        Malik was brought up in Madinah, where the Sunnah flourished, as the city was the place where a large number of the children and grandchildren of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions still lived. Indeed, some of his 900 teachers were drawn from among them, but the main figures who influenced him greatly were 'Abdullah ibn Hurmuz, his first teacher from whom Malik learnt to say, ‘I don’t know’ whenever he was unclear about a question, Nafi', the disciple of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, Muhammad ibn Shihab al-Zuhri and Rabi'ah ibn 'Abd al-Rahman, known by his nickname Rabi'ah al-Ra’y. When Malik relates a hadith quoting Nafi', this is considered the best chain of transmission, as it means Malik, Nafi', and 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar were quoting the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is called ‘the golden chain of transmission’. Al-Zuhri was the first scholar to collate the  Hadith, as he was instructed to do by the Caliph, 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz. When Rabi'ah died, Malik said: ‘The sweetness of Fiqh has gone.’
                      
                      
                        Imam Malik attained a very distinguished position as a scholar of Fiqh and  Hadith, and was recognized as a leading authority in both. He was one of the first scholars to produce an anthology of Hadith, which he included in his authoritative work, Al-Muwatta’. In Fiqh he always cared for people’s interests. 
                      
                      Speaking of him, Imam al-Shafi'i said: ‘When scholars are mentioned, Malik comes at the top. I am indebted to no one more than I am indebted to Malik.’ Imam Ahmad said: ‘Malik is among the leading scholars. He is an imam in both  Hadith and Fiqh. Who is to compare with Malik in his following of our predecessors and combining his learning with sound reason and fine manners?’
                      Methodology of the Maliki school
                      
                      Imam Malik did not write down the methodology he followed in arriving at rulings. However, the methodology is mentioned in the relevant books authored by scholars of his school, as they studied the detailed questions he looked into. The sources the Maliki school relies upon are the Qur’an, the Sunnah, the unanimity of the people of Madinah, analogy, statements by the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions, interests without rulings, customs of Muslims, prevention of what leads to prohibitions, istishab, and subtle analogy.

                        name: "Imam Al-Shafi'i",
                        content: `Abu 'Abdullah Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (150–204 AH/768–820 CE) was born in Gaza and was only two years old when his mother took him to Makkah, where his father’s family came from. He was brought up by his mother, who was a very devout woman, and by the age of seven, al-Shafi'i had completed memorizing the Qur’an, and by 10 he had memorized Al-Muwatta’, the Hadith and Fiqh anthology of Imam Malik. At a young age he joined the desert tribe of Hudhayl, one of the most eloquent Arabian tribes, where he learnt much of their poetry and stayed with them for some years. When he returned to Makkah, he had attained a superior standard of eloquence and knowledge of Arabic.


                        He studied under the scholars of Makkah, learning Fiqh under Muslim ibn Khalid al-Zanji, the top scholar at the Haram in Makkah. Al-Shafi'i excelled in Fiqh, Hadith and Arabic, and was authorized to give rulings when he was only 15, and he became a teacher at the Haram. He then traveled to join Imam Malik in Madinah, where he read Al-Muwatta’ under him. He stayed in Madinah until Malik’s death in 179 AH (794 CE), and at the age of 29 al-Shafi'i traveled to Iraq, where he became familiar with the Fiqh heritage of Abu Hanifah. He studied Abu Hanifah’s books, the main source of Hanafi Fiqh, under Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, and thus combined his learning of the Hijaz Fiqh with that of Iraq. During his studies, al-Shafi'i had several debates with Muhammad ibn al-Hasan. He returned to Makkah where he wrote his book, Al-Risalah, the first work ever on Fiqh methodology. He then traveled to Baghdad again where he was met by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal who studied under him. Leading scholars of Baghdad attended al-Shafi'i’s circle and were influenced by his methods.
                        
                         Ahmad ibn Hanbal said of him: “Al-Shafi'i was like the sun in this world, and like good health for people.” Can there ever be such great scholars?’   His contemporaries called him the Imam of the Sunnah and the champion of Hadith.
                        Methodology of the al-Shafi'i school
                        
                        Imam al-Shafi'i arranged the basis for rulings into five classes:
                        
                        1. The Quran and the Sunnah: Imam al-Shafi'i places the Sunnah at the same level with the Qur’an, as it explains the Quran and provides details of what is mentioned in general terms in the Quran.
                        
                        2-The unanimity of scholars on matters to which no text in the Quran or the Sunnah applies: He defined unanimity as the agreement on a specific ruling of all Muslim scholars, who are qualified to exercise ijtihad at any particular time after the Prophet (peace be upon him) had passed away. 
                        
                        3. Al-Shafi'i upholds the statement of any Companion of the Prophet (peace be upon him), provided there is no disagreement among the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions on the same matter. He would not take anyone’s view in preference to that of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions.
                        
                        4. When the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions disagreed on a ruling, he adopted the view that is closest to the Qur’an, the Sunnah and analogy.
                        
                        5. Analogy with a clear verdict in the Qur’an or the Sunnah: Analogy means applying a stated verdict to a question that carries no verdict, provided that the reasoning for this verdict applies equally to both questions. 
                        `

                        id: 4,
                        name: 'Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal',
                        content: `Ahmad ibn Hanbal (164–241 AH/782–856 CE) was born in Baghdad, which was at the time the capital of learning, with numerous scholars of Islamic studies and all other branches of study, and the capital of the Islamic state.

                        He was recognized as highly intelligent and very devout, and began his learning at a young age and memorized the Qur’an.  He lost his father when he was young and thereafter relied on his own efforts. As he grew up he earned a reputation for hard work, perseverance and patience in adversity.  Older scholars recognized that he had great potential. 
                       
                       Al-Haytham ibn Jamil is quoted as saying in reference to him: ‘Should this lad live to old age, he will be the scholar of his time.’
                       Methodology of the Hanbali school
                       
                       Ibn al-Qayyim explains the methodology adopted by Imam Ahmad in his rulings. It has five constituent elements: 
                       
                       1. Texts: When a text applies to a question that text constitutes the basis of his verdict. This is universally agreed by scholars.
                       
                       2. The rulings of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions, whenever they agreed on a question.
                       
                       3. When the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions disagreed, he would choose the view he considered closest to the Qur’an and the Sunnah, but he would not depart from what they ruled. If his view was different from all their rulings, he would report their views, without giving preference to any.
                       
                       4. Ahmad relied on hadiths that were lacking in authenticity when there was nothing under the same heading in conflict with these. Such hadiths must not be odd or contrary to the established truth, and must not include in their chains of transmission anyone who is considered unreliable. According to Ahmad, the Sunnah includes all authentic hadiths, the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions’ rulings, and hadiths that are lacking in authenticity.
                       
                       5. Analogy: Ahmad only resorted to analogy when necessary, i.e. when he was dealing with a question to which none of the above sources of evidence applied.

The most important work that expresses the views of this school is Mukhtasar Khalil, which has been annotated and explained by various scholars. These include al-Dardir’s Al-Sharh al-Kabir, with further annotations by Ibn 'Arafah al-Dusuqi; Muhammad Al-'Abdari al-Mawwaq’s Al-Taj wal-Iklil; and al-Hattab’s Hashiyat Mawahib al-Jalil fi Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil.

The most important of these are: 1) Muhammad al-Ramli’s Nihayat al-Muhtaj ila Sharh al-Minhaj; 2) Ahmad al-Haytami’s Tuhfat al-Muhtaj fi Sharh al-Minhaj; and 3) al-Khatib al-Shirbini’s Mughni al-Muhtaj ila Sharh al-Minhaj.

                        Among the most important works of this school is al-Mardawi’s Al-Insaf, in which the author takes particular care of including the various reports by Imam Ahmad and gives comparative assessment of these reports. Other famous works include Ibn Muflih’s Al-Furu', and those by later scholars include Mansur al-Bahuti’s Kashf al-Qina' 'an Matn al-Iqna'.

Filth or better known as Najasah in Arabic is physical substance that must be washed or removed from the body, clothes and the spot a worshipper is using for prayer. Urine, stool, menstrual blood, a dog’s saliva among other things are considered najis or impure. The second part of purity is uplifting both minor and major impurity. Minor impurity is caused by answering the call of nature, passing wind, sleeping or eating camel’s meat. Such minor ritual impurity is uplifted by performing ablution (wudhu). Major ritual impurity is caused by ejaculation, sexual intercourse or discharge of blood in menses or after giving birth. This major ritual impurity is uplifted by taking ritual bath or Ghusul.

                        :Allah says in the Qur’an

                        (6:145)
                        
                        The hide is considered to have been tanned when it is cleaned of all impurity and dirt using water mixed with salt or a tanning agent extracted from plants such as the Acacia nilotica.
                        
                        
                        The hide of dead animals that are not permissible to eat is not purified by tanning. Thus, the hide of a dead cat is not purified by tanning even though it is not impure when the cat is alive. This applies to the hide of all animals that are not permissible to eat.
                        
                        In summary, animals that die naturally are impure, but their hide is purified when tanned if they are normally permissible to eat. The hide of animals that are forbidden to eat is not purified by tanning..

On finishing and leaving, one is recommended to say: ‘I seek Your forgiveness.’ It is recommended to put one’s left foot first on entering and one’s right foot first on leaving, and not to uncover one’s private parts until one is close to the lavatory. If one is doing it in an open area, one is recommended to go far and seek a position where one cannot be seen. Most of these points are mentioned in the following hadiths:

                        God has forbidden some acts when one relives himself like urinating or defecating in stagnant water, by roadsides or reading Quran in the toilet. This article clarifies all these acts and the reason behind each.
                        
                        It is forbidden to urinate in stagnant water, as stated in the hadith reported by Jabir:

                        It is also forbidden to hold the Qur’an or to read it when one is in the toilet, as the Qur’an should always be treated with respect. One should not hold one’s penis with one’s right hand when urinating, and one should not use it to clean oneself after urination or defecation.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said

                        Shaving pubic hair: This is recommended for cleanliness. It may also be removed with hair removing products.
                        Circumcision: This means the removal of the foreskin that covers the head of a boy’s penis. It is very useful as it keeps the penis uncontaminated by the impurity of urine. It is recommended to have it done on the seventh day after birth, because it is quicker to heal. Female circumcision is practised in some countries, but unknown in the majority of Muslim countries. No hadith of good or authentic grade recommends it.
                        Trimming the moustache: The moustache should be heavily reduced, because this makes one better looking and cleaner. There are several hadiths urging the trimming of one’s moustache while growing one’s beard and taking care of it. A beard adds an element of dignity to man’s appearance and manliness. Many people today take the reverse attitude, growing their moustaches and shaving their beards. This is contrary to the Sunnah and to the clear recommendation to grow one’s beard.
                        :Abu Hurayrah quotes the Prophet (peace be upon him) as saying

                         Every Muslim should observe the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) guidance and choose a way that is contrary to the practices of the disbelievers. Moreover, Muslim men should make sure not to imitate women.
                        
                        Nail clipping: Nails must not be left long. To clip them gives a better appearance and prevents the collection of any dirt that might accumulate under them. Some people, including Muslims, take no heed of this important Sunnah, letting their nails, or a particular nail grow long.
                        Plucking armpit hair: The removal of armpit hair is recommended either by plucking or shaving. It is cleaner and reduces foul smell.
                        It is clear that Islam urges us to attend to these practices as they combine cleanliness with purification and good appearance. A Muslim who attends to them has the best appearance, and moves away from the practices of unbelievers and ignorant people. Furthermore, he earns reward as he implements the requirements of his faith and follows the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) guidance.

It also prevents bad mouth smell and is recommended at all times. The Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged the brushing of teeth generally, without specifying a time for it.
                        
                        :He also said

'A’ishah was asked what was the first thing the Prophet (peace be upon him) did when he came home. She answered: ‘He brushed his teeth.’ It is also strongly recommended if one has been silent for long, and when one’s teeth start to become yellowish.[1]

                        Brushing one’s teeth ensures several benefits. Most importantly, it keeps the mouth clean in this life and it earns Allah’s pleasure in the life to come. 
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said

                        Therefore, a Muslim should be keen to observe this practice and never to abandon it, as it is highly beneficial. Regrettably, some people may not brush their teeth for a month or two, either out of negligence, or because they are unaware of its benefits. Thus they miss out on Allah’s reward and the benefits it brings. They should remember that the Prophet (peace be upon him) always maintained this practice and ordered his community to follow his example. He would have made it obligatory, but he feared that some people might find it hard to maintain. Other benefits of teeth brushing have been mentioned, such as strengthening one’s teeth and preventing gum disease, as well as improving one’s voice and giving one a sense of refreshment.

If you are in a state of ceremonial impurity, purify yourselves. But if you are ill, or on a journey, or if one of you has come from the toilet, or if you have been in intimate contact with women and can find no water, then have recourse to pure dust, passing therewith lightly over your faces and your hands.

                        4-Removal of anything that prevents skin contact with water, such as the presence of wax or dough on some spots, or nail varnish.
                        
                        5-Immediate progress from one action to the next.
                        
                        6-Following the proper order.

                        5-Following the proper order: This is required because Allah mentions it in order and the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed his ablutions in the same order mentioned by Allah: the face, then the arms, then the head then the feet. This is clearly indicated by the hadith reported by 'Abdullah ibn Zayd and in other hadith describing the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) ablution.
                        
                        6-Continuous progress: This means washing one organ immediately after the one before it, without delay. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to perform his ablution without leaving gaps between washing the different parts. This is further confirmed by the hadith reported by Khalid ibn Ma'dan:
                        
                        
                        
                        ‘The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man praying and noticed that there was on the top of his foot a spot the size of a coin which was dry, because water did not touch it when the man performed his ablution. The Prophet ordered him to repeat his ablution.’

                         Had it not been necessary for ablution to be consecutive without any gap, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have told the man only to wash the unwashed part, not to repeat his ablution.

                        Certain actions are recommended when performing the ablution. These are Sunnah, which means that a person who does them earns a reward, while the one who omits them misses out on a reward but his ablution is valid. These are:

                    1-A discharge through one’s private parts. This applies for any discharge of urine, stools, semen, blood or wind, of any amount. In the Qur’anic verse that mentions the situations when ablution becomes required for prayer,

                    2-A discharge of impurity from any part of the body. If the discharge is urine or stools, it certainly invalidates the ablution.
                    
                    3-Loss of the mental faculty, as in the case of sleep.
                    
                    :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said

                    On the other hand, madness, drunkenness and loss of consciousness invalidate the ablution according to all scholars. Sleep that invalidates the ablution is deep sleep when the sleeper loses all awareness, no matter in what position one is asleep. Dosing off slightly does not invalidate the ablution.
                    
                    The Prophet’s (peace be upon him) companions used to be very drowsy as they awaited
                    
                    ‘Isha’ prayer, and then they would stand up and pray without performing a fresh ablution.’

A large number of early eminent scholars are of the view that the Qur’an is permissible to be held by a person who has not performed the ordinary ablution, i.e. wudu’, provided that he has not incurred the need for grand ablution, i.e. ghusl.

                    Ruling and its basis
                    
                    To wipe over the khuff instead of washing one’s feet for ablution is valid according to the general view of Sunni scholars. It is a concession given by Allah to make things easier for His servants. This concession is based on the Sunnah and unanimity of scholars. As for the Sunnah, there are numerous hadiths confirming its validity as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did it and instructed others to do it. Sunni scholars are unanimous that it is valid in travel and at home, whether there is a necessity or not.
                    
                    Likewise, it is permissible to wipe over socks, because they are equally needed by people, and they are widely used. Hence, the permissibility to wipe over socks provided they cover the feet up to the ankles.

                        content: `Instead of removing your socks or khuffs during each ablution, one can wipe over it. But there are some conditions and rules to be followed so the wiping is valid. This article discusses these conditions in details.

1-One must have a valid ablution at the time when one wears the khuffs , or socks.

:Al-Mughirah reports

‘I was accompanying the Prophet (peace be upon him) on travel, and I went down to help him take off his khuffs, but he said to me: “Leave them on, as I wore them .(while in the state of purification and wudhu). He wiped over them.’

Related by al-Bukhari, hadith  No. 206; Muslim, hadith No. 274

2. Covering all the feet. The khuffs must cover all the part of one’s legs that must be washed for ablution, i.e. all the feet up to the ankles. If any part is uncovered, wiping over them is invalid. Ibn Taymiyyah differs with such a ruling and makes it clear in his Fatawa that this condition has no firm basis.

3-They should be permissible to wear. It is not permissible to wipe over the khuffs or socks if they are taken from their owner by force, or stolen, or made of silk because wearing silk is forbidden for men.

4-They should be pure, as it is not allowed to wipe over khuffs made of something impure, such as the hide of donkey.

5-Using the concession within the time allowed. Wiping over the khuffs is valid for one day and night for one who is in his own home town, and for three consecutive days and nights for one on travel.

For example, if one performs the ablution for Fajr (i.e. dawn) prayer and wears the khuffs, then his ablution is invalidated after sunrise, and he does not perform another ablution until he performs the ablution for Thuhur (i.e. noon) prayer, his period of the concession starts at Thuhur time. Some scholars are of the view that it starts at the time he performs the ablution for Thuhur prayer, i.e. from the time of his first wiping.`

                        Taking a bath, i.e. performing the ghusl, is obligatory in the following cases:
                        
                        1-The ejaculation of semen as per the ayah mentioned above.
                        
                        :Ali said
                        
                        ‘If you ejaculate, then perform the ghusl.’

                         However, if the discharge is in a wet dream, it still requires a bath, even if the sleeper does not feel the orgasm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked whether a woman must take a bath if she had a wet dream.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘Yes, if she confirms a discharge .’
                        
                         
                        Related by Muslim, hadith No. 313
                        
                         This is agreed by all scholars. It is important to note that the discharge of semen without an orgasm, as in the case of illness, does not require a ghusl, and the same is the case for one who sees a sexual dream but there is no trace of a discharge of semen. On the other hand, if on rising from sleep, one feels wetness but cannot remember a wet dream, one must perform the ghusl if one ascertains that the wetness is semen. Moreover, if one finds on one’s clothes traces of a discharge of semen but cannot ascertain its time, and he has already prayed once or more, he should perform the ghusl and repeat any prayer he offered since his last sleep.
                        
                        2-The insertion of the top of the penis into a woman’s vagina, even if no discharge takes place.

                        3- Embracing Islam by an unbeliever.

                        4-When a woman finishes her menstrual period or postnatal bleeding. A’ishah reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaysh:

                        content: `Women ghusl procedure starts by pouring water on her hair for three times making sure that the water reaches the skin of her head then she continues washing the rest of her body.

                        There are two forms of ghusl: 
                        
                        A) Acceptable form: in the sense that if a person only does ghusl in this manner, his ghusl is valid and he becomes purified from major impurity. But if a person fails to perform this kind of ghusl properly, his ghusl is not needvalid. 
                        
                        B) Complete and preferred form: this is the type which it is recommended to do but is not obligatory.
                        
                        As for the obligatory and acceptable form it is as follows: 
                        
                        1. Form the intention to purify oneself from impurity: janaabah (impurity following ejaculation), menses or nifaas (postpartum bleeding).
                        
                        2.  Wash the entire body with water once, making sure that the water reaches the roots of the hair and the places that it cannot reach easily, such as the armpits and backs of the knees, as well as rinsing the mouth and nose, according to the correct scholarly opinion.
                        
                        As for the complete form, it is as follows:
                        
                        1.  Form the intention in the heart to purify oneself from major impurity: janaabah (impurity following ejaculation), menses or nifaas (postpartum bleeding).
                        
                        2.  Then say Bismillah and wash the hands three times, then wash any dirt from the private part.
                        
                        3. Then do a complete wudoo’ as for prayer.
                        
                        4. Then pour water over the head three times, and rub the hair so that the water reaches the roots of the hair.
                        
                        5. Then wash the body, making sure that the water reaches all parts, rubbing it with the hands so that the water reaches the entire body. 
                        
                        The evidence for this preferred form of ghusl is: 
                        
                        :It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said
                        
                        ‘When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did ghusl for janaabah, he would wash his hands and do wudoo’ as for prayer, then he would wash himself, then he would run his fingers through his hair, then when he thought that it [the water] had reached his skin, he would pour water over it [the head] three times, then he would wash the rest of his body.’ `

If you are in a state of ceremonial impurity, purify yourselves. But if you are ill, or on a journey, or if one of you has come from the toilet, or if you have been in intimate contact with women and can find no water, then have recourse to pure dust, passing therewith lightly over your faces and your hands. God does not want to impose any hardship on you, but He wants to purify you, and to bestow on you the full measure of His blessings, so that you may be grateful.’

                        Scholars are unanimous that dry ablution is perfectly legitimate when the conditions for it apply. They also agree that it replaces purification with water, making it permissible to pray, perform the tawaf, recite the Qur’an, etc.

                        1-Intention to uplift minor or major impurity: Intention is required in all types of worship, and dry ablution is an act of worship.
                        
                        2-Possession of mental faculties: Dry ablution is invalid if done by an insane person or performed for an unconscious person.
                        
                        3-Awareness: It is not valid if done by one who does not distinguish actions, such as a child below seven years of age.
                        
                        4-Inability to use water for ablution: This may be due to the unavailability of water.
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘If you can find no water, then have recourse to pure dust, passing therewith lightly over your faces and your hands.’

                         as this is better.’ Alternatively, the inability to use water may be due to fear that it causes harm. This may apply to a person who is ill and fears that water might aggravate his complaint or delay his recovery. In the Qur’anic verse mentioning ablution, Allah mentions illness as a valid reason for dry ablution. Moreover,

He, therefore, took a bath, and he died soon after. When we returned, we mentioned this to

For example, it is invalid if the dust had been urinated upon and it was not subsequently purified. It should also be dry with fine dust attaching to one’s hand when it is struck.

                        This ruling applies to utensils, Other materials such as clothes or furniture items would only be washed once. 
                        
                        
                        As for the impurity of the pig, it is the correct view that it is like other impurities and its removal requires washing it off once only, provided that the wash leaves no trace of the impurity. It is not required to be washed seven times.[2]
                        
                        
                        If the impurity is urine, faeces, blood, or the like, it is washed, rubbed and squeezed until no trace of it is left. One wash is enough if it leaves no trace. The impurity of the urine of a male infant who has not eaten normal food may be removed by sprinkling water over it,
                        
                        :as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘The urine of a female child should be washed while that of a male child should be sprinkled with water.’

                        ‘Any hide that is tanned is free of impurity.’ If menses stains a woman’s garment, it is washed with water; a woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: Menstrual blood may get onto the clothes of any one of us; what should she do with it? He said: “She should scratch it, then rub it with water, then wash it, then pray in it.’
                        
                        This has been related by al-Bukhari (227) and Muslim 291
                        
                        
                        It is important to take the necessary care to remove any impurity, whether it falls on one’s body, clothes or the place where one prays, because to be free of impurity is essential for the validity and acceptance of prayer.

                        It has been confirmed that no period of menstruation occurs in girls younger than nine years of age. :A’ishah is quoted as saying
                        
                        ‘When a girl completes nine years, then she is a woman.’

                         Likewise, by the age of 50 most women will have stopped menstruating. 'A’ishah is reported to have said: ‘When a woman is 50 years of age, she stops menstruation.’[2]

                        ‘Your period of menstruation is six or seven days, as Allah knows best, then take a bath and pray for 24 or 23 days, as other women menstruate and have their time of purification in their regular periods.’

                        Some scholars are of the view that there is no minimum or maximum length of a woman’s period, and that it is determined by the custom of women in the family or community.

                        1-It requires a bath at the end:
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a woman

                        This signifies that once a girl begins to have the period, she must cover her head, which means that Islamic duties apply to her and this takes place only when a person attains puberty.
                        
                        3-It is a significant mark: A divorced woman’s waiting period is considered to have been completed when she has had three menstruations.

                        Important note: When a woman finishes her period before sunset, she must offer her Thuhur and 'Asr prayers for that day; and if she finishes her period before dawn, she must offer her Maghrib and 'Isha’ prayers for that night. The time of each two prayers is considered one when there is a valid reason to delay the first prayer. This is the view of the majority of scholars, and it is upheld by Malik, al-Shafi'i and Ahmad.`

                        Prayer is a demonstration of man’s gratitude for the numerous great blessings Allah has bestowed on him. It is also an unmistakeable manifestation of man’s servitude to Allah. In prayer a person speaks directly to Allah, shows humility before Him, and addresses Him with reciting the Qur’an, glorification and supplication. Moreover, in prayer man feels his bond with Allah, which elevates him over the material world in order to give him clearer vision and reassurance. When the concerns and temptations of life become too strong, prayer helps man to regain his proper perspective, enabling him to see the truth and giving him a sense of what is greater and beyond. He will realize that life could not have been so perfect, and that things could not have been made subservient to man, in order to leave him living on the margin, caring nothing except for immediate enjoyments.[2]
                        
                        Prayer provides light in this life and in the life to come. It is a cause for bestowing Allah’s mercy on man and increasing his provisions. It also ensures forgiveness of sins, increase of good deeds and elevating man’s position with Allah.
                        
                        Prayer provides spiritual nourishment. When we wish to rise to a higher level, we should fulfil all our duties, particularly prayer. When a person performs the ablution and stands up in full humility to pray, addressing Allah, supplicating in hope and looking forward for Allah’s grace, he will enjoy inner comfort and reassurance because he has assigned all his cares and concerns to the One who is ever merciful, the One to whom all dominion belongs and who is able to accomplish everything.

                        name: 'The call to prayer',
                        content: `Being a caller to prayer is an honor that shouldn't be granted to anyone. The one who recites Adhan and iqamah to remind all Muslims of their prayers must be honest, sane adult, trustworthy, and have a loud voice.

                        The Arabic term adhan, originally means ‘making an announcement’, and it is used in this sense in verse 9: 3 of the Qur’an. In an Islamic context it means ‘an announcement in specific wording at designated times informing people that prayer is due,’ while iqamah informs people in specific wording given by the Legislator that they should rise to pray.[1]
                        
                        
                        Status:
                        
                        Both the adhan and the iqamah are collective duties, which means that when they are performed by some people, the rest are not accountable. Both are clearly apparent Islamic rituals and, therefore, it is not permissible to neglect them.[2]
                        
                        
                        Conditions
                        
                        1-They must be done by a sane Muslim man. If they are done by an unbeliever, a mad or drunken person, or one who is too young then they are invalid. These are common requirements for all types of Islamic worship.
                        
                        2-The adhan must be done at the time when the prayer falls due. If it is done earlier, it is invalid. The iqamah should be done just before starting the prayer.
                        
                        3-Both should be done in the right order, without gaps.
                        
                        4-Both should be done in Arabic and in the specific wording explained in the Sunnah.
                        
                        
                        Women are not required to do either of these duties, but a number of eminent scholars, such as al-Shafi'i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal say that it is perfectly acceptable if they do or not.

                        Qualities the caller to prayer should possess
                        
                        1-He should be an honest, trustworthy person, because he is referred to in the matter of prayer and fasting.
                        
                        2-He should be a sane adult. However, if a boy who is aware of his actions calls the adhan, his action is valid.
                        
                        3-He should know the times for prayer, so as to make sure to call the adhan on time. If he is not fully aware of the relevant times, he may be in error.
                        
                        4-He should have a loud voice.
                        
                        5-He should purify himself after any discharge that invalidates ablution.
                        
                        6-He should say the adhan facing the qiblah.
                        
                        7-He should place his forefingers in his two ears and turn his face to the right when saying hayy 'ala al-salah and to the left when saying hayy 'ala al-falah.However, if he is giving the Athan via loudspeakers as in the case of modern mosques, turning left and right wold weaken the sound and hence one shouldn’t do it.
                        
                        8-He should elongate the adhan and be quick with the iqamah.

                        :It was narrated that ‘Abdallah ibn Zayd said
                        
                        ‘When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered that a bell should be made so that it could be struck to call the people to prayer, a man walked around me whilst I was sleeping [i.e., in a dream], carrying a bell in his hand. I said, “O slave of Allah, will you sell this bell?” He asked, “What will you do with it?” I said, “We will call the people to prayer.” He said, “Shall I not tell you of something better than that?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Say: Allah-u akbar (four times); Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah (two times); Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah (two times); hayy [ala al-salah (two times); hayy [ala al-falah (two times); Allah-u akbar Allah-u akbar; La ilaha illa Allah.Then he went a short distance away from me and said: “And when the prayer is about to begin (iqamah), say: Allah-u akbar Allah-u akbar; Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah; Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah; hayy [ala al-salah; hayy [ala al-falah; Qad qamat al-salah qad qamat al-salah; Allah-u akbar; La ilaha illa Allah. The following morning, I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and told him what I had seen. He said, “This is a true dream, in sha Allah. Get up with Bilal and teach him what you saw, for he has a more melodious voice than you.” So I got up with Bilal and taught him, and he gave the call to prayer. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab heard that in his house and he came out, dragging his lower garment and saying, “By the One Who sent you with the truth, O Messenger of Allah, I saw the same as he saw!” The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “To Allah be praise.’

                        These are the preferred forms of adhan and iqamah, but if in adhan one repeats the phrases testifying Allah’s oneness and the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) message, or repeats the phrases of iqamah twice, there is no harm because this is  an acceptable difference between scholars. In the adhan for Fajr (i.e. dawn) prayer, it is mandatory to add the phrase assalatu khayrun min al-nawm, which means ‘prayer is preferable to sleep’,

                        1-Islam: Prayer is not valid if performed by an unbeliever.
                        
                        2-Sanity: Prayer is not valid if performed by an insane person, because it is not required of the insane.
                        
                        3-Puberty: Praying is not required of a child until he or she attains puberty. However, a child should be instructed to perform the prayer when it is seven years of age. The order may be coupled with gentle beating if the child does not pray after reaching 10 years of age.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘Order your children to pray when they are seven, and beat them gently for not praying after they are ten.’
                        
                        4- Purification: This includes both types of purity; purity from najasah (impurities) on one’s body, clothes and the prayer area and it also includes uplifiting the ritual state of impurity through wudhu or dry ablution.
                        
                        5-Appropriate time: Each prayer has its appointed time range and for a prayer to be valid, it has to be offered within that time range.
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.’

                         A hadith mentions that the angel Gabriel led the Prophet (peace be upon him) in offering all five prayers on two consecutive days, choosing the beginning of the time of every prayer on the first day, and the end of its time range on the second day.
                        
                        :He then told the Prophet (peace be upon him)
                        
                        ‘Prayer is valid between these two times.’

                         This means that prayer is invalid before its time is due, or after it had lapsed, except for a valid reason.
                        
                        6- Covering the Awrah, The Awrah of a man in prayer is the area from his navel to his knees. The woman’s awrah in prayer is her full body except her face and hands. The cover must not be transparent.

                        2-Allah’s glorification at the beginning of prayer: This is to say Allah-u akbar, which means ‘Allah is supreme’. Nothing other than this glorification is acceptable. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man praying wrongly,

                        7-Lifting one’s head after prostration, sitting between the two prostrations and standing up after the second. The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught the one who prayed wrong: ‘You then sit comfortably.
                        
                        8-Taking a comfortable position in all rukns, which signifies being still. This is equivalent to the time it takes to say what is required in every rukn. We note that the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered the one who did not pray well to ensure this in every rukn and to repeat his prayer because it was lacking in his first prayer.
                        
                        9-tashahhud.

                        The fact that Ibn Mas'ud said ‘Before it was made obligatory’ makes clear that it is obligatory.
                        
                        10-Sitting down for the last tashahhud, because this was consistently done by the Prophet (peace be upon him) , and he said:

                        This means that when a worshipper finishes his prayer, he turns his face to the right and says:

                        12-Doing all the rukns in the right order, because the Prophet did them in this order and

                        Furthermore, when he taught the person who did not pray well, he explained every rukn and said ‘then’ before mentioning the next one. This indicates that the rukns should be done in order.

                        content: `There are some recommendations that Muslims should keep in mind when they pray. These recommendations are actions and words that the prophet (PBUH) has performed and his companions followed his footsteps.

                        8- Saying the tasbeeh (when bowing or in prostration) more than once, such as a second or third time or more.

                         8- Holding the knees with fingers spread apart when bowing, holding the back straight and making the head parallel with it.
                        
                         9- Placing the parts of the body on which one prostrates firmly on the ground. Keeping the elbows away from the sides, and the belly from the thighs, and the thighs from the calves; keeping the knees apart; holding the feet upright; placing the hands level with the shoulders with the fingers spread.
                        
                        10- Sitting between the two prostrations and in the first tashahhud in a way that is known as Iftirash. This is sitting on the left foot while raising the right foot. In the last rak'ah of a 3 or 4 rak'ah prayers, the Sunnah is to sit in what is known as Tawarruk. This is to sit on the left hip while placing the left foot underneath the right leg. 
                        
                        11- Placing the hands on the thighs with the fingers together between the two prostrations, and in the tashahhud, except that in the latter the pinkie and ring fingers should be held in, a circle made with the middle finger and thumb, and one should point with the forefinger while shaking it in its place when in the tashahud position.
                        
                        12- Turning to the right and left when saying the salaam to conclude the prayers. `

                        name: 'What invalidates the prayer',
                        content: `Prayers are all Muslims' duty. But prayer is invalid in some cases like; invalid purification, loud laughter, or deliberately changing or adding a rukn. Learn what to avoid in order not to invalidate the prayer.

                        A prayer becomes invalid in several cases that are summed up as follows:[1]
                        
                        1-Whatever invalidates purification also invalidates prayer, because purification is a condition for the validity of prayer. The absence of this condition renders the prayer invalid.
                        
                        2-Loud laughter: This is universally agreed,[2] because it is like speaking, if not worse. Such laughter indicates total disrespect and is totally inconsistent with prayer and the need to show humiliation before Allah, who commands us:
                        
                        Stand up before Allah in devout obedience
                        
                        (2:238)
                        
                        A mere smile, however, does not invalidate prayer, as reported by Ibn al-Mundhir and others.
                        
                        3-Deliberate normal speech for any purpose other than that of the prayer itself.[3] Zayd ibn Arqam reports: ‘We used to speak during prayer, with a man talking to the one next to him in the row. Then the order was revealed:
                        
                        Stand up before Allah in devout obedience
                        
                        (2:238)
                        
                         We were commanded to be silent and forbidden to speak
                        
                        Related by al-Bukhari, hadith No. 4,534; Muslim, hadith No. 539
                        
                         If one is unaware of the prohibition, or is in a state of oblivion and speaks, his prayer in not invalidated.
                        
                        4-Deliberate exposure of one’s Awrah.
                        
                        5-Turning one’s back towards the qiblah, because facing the qiblah is a condition for the validity of prayer.
                        
                        6-Contact with impurity: When the worshipper is aware of any contact with impurity, or when he starts the prayer forgetting having had such contact then remembers it during the prayer, and does not immediately remove it, this invalidates prayer.
                        
                        7-Deliberately omitting an essential duty, whether it is a pillar, an obligatory act or a condition of the prayer without a valid reason.
                        
                        8-Doing any of several things that are not related to the prayer, such as eating and drinking.
                        
                        9-Leaning against something without any legitimate reason, because standing up is a condition for the validity of prayer.
                        
                        10-Deliberately adding a rukn that involves an action, such as doing more than one bowing or more than two prostrations in one rak'ah. Needless to say, this alters the form of prayer and as such, the prayer becomes invalid according to the universal view of scholars.
                        
                        11-Deliberately changing the order of rukns, because following the proper order is itself a rukn as we have already noted.
                        
                        12-Deliberately saying Assalamu 'alaikum before prayer is finished.
                        
                        13-Deliberately changing the meaning when reciting al-Fatihah, as its recitation is a rukn.

                        content: `During prayers, one has to avoid some acts that are discouraged in a prayer. Those acts such as; moving too much, reciting only the Fatha in the first tow rakaa, closing the eyes, and other gestures discussed below.

                        What is reprehensible in prayer
                        The following are discouraged in prayer :[1]
                        
                        1-Reciting only the first surah, al-Fatihah, in the first two rak'ahs because this is against the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) practice and guidance.
                        
                        2-Repeating the surah, al-Fatihah, in the same rak'ah, because this is also against the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) practice. However, if one repeats it for a reason, as in the case of someone who has read it mechanically the first time and wanted to reflect on its meaning by reciting it again, then there is no harm, provided this does not lead to obsession.
                        
                        3-Turning one’s face slightly during prayer, without a reason, is also discouraged. When asked about this, 
                        
                        :the Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘This is a time stolen by Satan from a person’s prayer.’
                        
                        Related by al-Bukhari, hadith No. 751
                        
                         If turning is for a reason, as in the case of someone who starts to have disturbing doubts about his prayer and needs to make the spitting gesture three times to the left during prayer, this is acceptable. In fact the Prophet (peace be upon him) recommended it in such a case. The same applies to a woman who is worried about a young child or a toddler who might be wandering around and she fears that the child might be lost. All this applies to slight turning, but if a person turns with his whole body, or turns his back towards the qiblah, then the prayer becomes invalid, unless there is a legitimate reason such as strong fear, etc.
                        
                        4-Closing one’s eyes in prayer, because this would be imitating the worship of the Majians, and it is also said that this is similar to what the Jews do. We, Muslims, are commanded not to be like the unbelievers.
                        
                        5-Placing one’s arms, up to the elbows, on the floor during prostration.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘Let your body be in the right position when you prostrate yourself, and let not any of you place his arms on the floor like a dog does.’ It is, therefore, important to lift one’s arms above the floor, so as not to take a posture like an animal.’
                        
                        6-Making many movements, because this is contrary to the humble appearance required in prayer.
                        
                        7-Placing one’s hands over one’s waist on both sides.
                        
                        :Abu Hurayrah said
                        
                        ‘The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited that a man puts his hands over his waist on both sides.’

                        8-  Praying without having anything covering a man’s shoulders. Also it is disliked to pray while covering one’s mouth without a legitimate reason.[2]
                        
                        9-Starting movements before the imam in congregational prayers.
                        
                        :The Prophet  (peace be upon him) said

                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) told
                        
                        ‘someone who performed the ablution and came to the mosque for prayer that he should not do so.’

                        11-Folding one’s hair or clothes.
                        
                         Ibn 'Abbas reports: ‘The Prophet (peace be upon him) was commanded to place seven bones on the floor in prostration and not to fold his clothes or hair. This means one shouldn’t fold his sleeves or clothes for prayer but rather leave it loose to bow and prostrate with him and also not to gather the hair if it is long in a bun for example for prayer.
                        12-Praying when food is present or when one has the urge to go to the toilet.

                        Muslims are agreed that offering the five obligatory prayers in mosques is one of the best acts undertaken in obedience to Allah. Allah has given the Muslim community the opportunity to meet at certain times, such as the five daily prayers, the Friday prayer, the prayer on the two Eid days, and the prayer when there is an eclipse. These are great meetings and they serve the interests of the Muslim community, as people meet and discuss their affairs, as well as the affairs of other Muslim communities.

This is so because when he performs the ablution at home, then goes out to the mosque for no reason other than attending the prayer, he is given a grade and forgiven a sin for every step he makes. When he is actually engaged in prayer, the angels bless him as long as he is at his place of worship.’

                        Status: Congregational prayer is a duty for Muslim men, and this is clear in both the Qur’an and the Sunnah.
                        
                        :Allah says in the Qur’an
                        
                        ‘When you are with the believers and about to lead them in prayer, let one group of them stand up with you.’
                        
                        (4:102)
                        
                         The formula, ‘let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you’ is expressed in the Arabic text in the imperative form, and this form clearly indicates obligation. It is true that this verse refers to a situation when the Muslim community is in a state of fear, as in a situation where an enemy force may attack them. Needless to say, the order applies even more clearly in a state of peace.
                        
                        The evidence from the Sunnah is found in the hadith
                        
                        :reported by Abu Hurayrah
                        
                        ‘Allah’s messenger said: “The prayers found too hard by the hypocrites are 'Isha’ and Fajr. Had they known how much goodness they bring, they would have come crawling to join them, even though they would have to crawl. I have even thought of ordering the prayer to be held and ordering one of you to lead the prayer, then I would go with some men carrying bundles of firewood. We would go to some people who abstain from coming to prayer and I would burn their homes.’

                        The hadith clearly indicates that the congregational prayer is a duty, because: 
                        
                        1) the Prophet (peace be upon him) described those who do not attend it as ‘hypocrites’, but a person who does not perform a Sunnah, or a recommended practice, is never considered hypocrite. This means that they have abstained from a duty. 
                        
                        2) The Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he had thought of punishing them severely for staying away from the congregational prayer. Punishment is only inflicted for failing to do a duty. What stopped him from acting on this idea was that punishment by fire is only inflicted by Allah. Some scholars also say what stopped him from punishing them in this way was the fact that there were women and children in those homes, and these are not required to attend congregational prayers.
                        
                        
                        Another report mentions that a blind man asked the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) permission to offer his prayers at home. The Prophet asked him whether he could hear the adhan when he was at home. He affirmed that he could.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said

                        Congregational prayer is a duty that is applicable to men, but not to women or children who have not yet attained puberty. In reference to women,
                        
                        :the Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘Their homes are better for them.’

                         However, there is no reason to prevent women from attending congregational prayers at the mosque, provided they go out properly dressed, fearing nothing. It is correct to say that attending congregational prayers at the mosque is binding on those to whom it applies. For a person who does not attend the congregational prayer, choosing instead to offer his prayers alone, his prayer is valid but he incurs the sin of failing to do a duty if he were in the vicinity of a masjid.
                        
                        The person to lead the congregational prayer in the mosque is the regular imam, or the one who knows the Qur’an best. It is acceptable that a young person or a blind man should lead the prayer. It is permissible for a person offering an obligatory prayer to lead another offering a voluntary prayer, or the reverse. Likewise, a traveller may lead the prayer, with residents behind him, or a resident leads with travellers behind him. A person who performed the normal ablution may lead the one who had only dry ablution, or the reverse. An imam may lead the prayer even when there are in the congregation one or more people who are better qualified to lead it.
                        
                        
                        It is preferable when there is a group of women offering a prayer that one of them should lead the prayer.
                        
                          'A’ishah used to lead a group of women in prayer, standing among them in the first row. Umm Salamah also used to do the same. The Prophet (peace be upon him) appointed Waraqah to do the adhan for her, and ordered her to lead the members of her household in obligatory prayers. However, if a man leads the prayer when there are only women in the congregation, this is acceptable.

                        Friday prayer is a duty binding on every Muslim male who is free, sane, having attained puberty and is present in the area where he resides. This means that a person to whom any of these does not apply is exempt from Friday prayer.

                        It is not binding on a person who is travelling because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not offer Friday prayer on any of his travels. When he offered the pilgrimage, it happened that the day of attendance at Arafat was a Friday, but the Prophet did not offer Friday prayer then. He offered Thuhur and combined it with Asr. A traveller who finds himself in a town where Friday prayer is offered should offer it with the Muslim community. Moreover, if a slave, a woman, a child, an ill person or a traveller attends it, it is acceptable and replaces Thuhur prayer.

                        Friday prayer is offered at the same time as Thuhur prayer, i.e. just after the sun has started to move down at midday, up until the shade of any object is equal to its height.

                        Giving a sermon is a rukn of Friday prayer, and it is invalid without it, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did it all the time, never omitting it. It is of two parts that must be completed before the prayer.[3] The Imam must praise Allah, say the testimony of Tawheed and salutation and to recite at least one ayah.

                        It is recommended to include in the sermon, or khutbah, a supplication for the Muslim community praying to Allah to grant them what gives them a happy life in this world and in the life to come, and to pray to rulers to be God-fearing and guided towards what benefits their communities. This is following the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) practice, because ‘the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to supplicate when he gave the khutbah on Friday,
                        
                        :and as he supplicated

                        Needless to say, to do so hurts people and diverts their attention from listening to the khutbah. Only the imam may do so if he cannot otherwise reach his place. It is also reprehensible to separate two people and sit between them.

Then when the imam starts, the angels attend to listen to Allah’s praises.’

In fact, everyone should be keen to take a bath on Friday, particularly if one is known to have an unpleasant smell. Some scholars consider it a duty, because of a hadith

                        However, the most authentic opinion is that it is highly recommended.
                        
                        3-Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to wear perfume and take care of one’s cleanliness, removing whatever needs to be removed of one’s body, such as clipping one’s nails. This is more than taking a bath, as it involves removing bad smells and their causes, such as removing any hair that is recommended to be shaved, such as pubic hair, armpit hair, trimming one’s moustache. 
                        
                        Though there is no authentic hadeeth recommending this, there are a lot of evidences stating that the companions and the scholars of different schools of thought recommended it.
                        
                        4-It is recommended also to wear some of one’s best clothes. Ibn Umar reports: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab saw a fine suit near the door of the mosque, and said: “Allah’s messenger, you may wish to buy this suit and wear it on Fridays and to receive delegations when they come.”’ Al-Bukhari considers this report to indicate the preferability of wearing one’s best clothes for Friday prayer. Hence, he enters it in his anthology under the heading: ‘Wearing one’s best clothes.’ Ibn Hajar said: ‘This hadith is treated as evidence supporting the idea of wearing good clothes for Friday prayer because the Prophet (peace be upon him) approved Umar’s idea of maintaining good appearance on Fridays. Moreover,
                        
                        :the Prophet (peace be upon him) says
                        
                        ‘Anyone of you will do well to buy two garments to use on Fridays instead of the two he wears for attending to his work.’

                        6-Another Sunnah is to recite in the Fajr prayer Surahs 33 and 76, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) frequently did so, and to recite Surah 18, during the day.

                        8-Another Sunnah is frequent supplication on Friday, hoping to make his supplication at the time when prayers are answered.
                        
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) says: ‘In every Friday, there is  an hour, in which any Muslim who happens to be standing up in prayer at that time, and prays to Allah for anything, Allah will certainly grant it to him or her.’

                        Muslims have two Eids a year. The Eid is an occasion of pleasure and happiness, and each of the two Eids has a religious significance. The first, Eid al-Fitr, occurs when Muslims have finished fasting the month of Ramadan, while the second, Eid al-Adha, signals the end of the first 10 days of the lunar month, Dhul-Hijjah.
                        
                        
                        Ruling:
                        
                        The Eid prayer is a collective duty, which means that when some Muslims offer it, the rest are not accountable for their omission. If no one offers it, then all share in the sin. This is because it is one of the clearest manifestations of the Islamic identity of the community. Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) always did it, as did his Companions after he had passed away. The Prophet (peace be upon him) even ordered that women who were in their periods, and were as a result exempt from prayer, attend it, but were not to take part in the prayer itself. They attend to share in its blessings and in the joy of the community, which clearly indicates its importance. If the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered women who were exempt from prayer to attend, then its attendance is more strongly incumbent on men. In fact some scholars consider it mandatory duty on all men.
                        
                        
                        Many scholars, however, are of the view that it is a confirmed Sunnah, i.e. highly recommended, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered it regularly and ordered men and women to attend it.
                        
                        Conditions:
                        
                         The most important conditions are that it should be offered in time, the presence of the required number of people and residence. This means that it is invalid if offered before it falls due, or if attended by less than three people. Moreover, it is not required of a person who is travelling.[1]

                        It is recommended to offer the Eid prayer in an open space away from residential buildings. 
                        
                        :Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reports
                        
                        ‘The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to go out to pray the Eid prayer of al-Fitr and al-Adha in the open space.’

                        Apparently this he did in order to publicize this Islamic tradition. It is permissible to offer it in a large mosque when there is need for that, such as rain, strong winds or other severe weather conditions.[2]
                        
                        
                        Time:
                        
                        The Eid prayer becomes due at the time when the Sunnah prayer known as Duha is due, which means it starts when the sun has risen in the sky about one spear’s length. This is when the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his successors used to offer it, and prior to the sun being at that height, prayer is discouraged.[3] It is recommended to start the Eid al-Adha prayer at the beginning of its time range and to delay the Eid al-Fitr prayer because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did that. People need to attend to their sacrifice after the prayer at Eid al-Adha, while the delay in Eid al-Fitr prayer helps a person who has not yet paid Zakat al-Fitr to pay it, as it must be paid up to immediately before the prayer.[4]

                        The Eid prayer consists of two rak'ahs, similar to the  Friday prayer, In the first rak'ah and after the Takbeer (glorification), Allah-u akbar, and the opening supplication, the same after that, al-Fatiha and another surah are recited glorification of takbeer is repeated seven more times, after that, al-Fatiha and another surah are recited . In the second rak'ah the same takbeer is repeated five times, other than the takbeer for standing up from sujood before reciting al-Fatihah. This is based on the hadith.

                        It is not recommended for anyone who misses out on the Eid prayer to offer it after it has finished, because this was not reported as suggested by the Prophet (peace be upon him). Moreover, it is a prayer for which a certain congregation gathers. It must, therefore, be offered in this fashion.
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        What is recommended:
                        
                        1-It is a Sunnah, i.e. recommended, that the Eid prayer is organized at an open, well known space, preferably outside the village or town, so that the community can gather and perform this distinctive act of worship. However, if it is offered in mosques for one reason or another, the prayer is still valid.
                        
                        2-As noted when we referred to its time, it is recommended to start the Eid al-Adha prayer early and to delay the Eid al-Fitr prayer.
                        
                         ‘It is also a Sunnah to eat a few dates before going out to offer the Eid al-Fitr prayer, and not to eat anything on Eid al-Adha until the Eid prayer has finished and one eats from his sacrifice, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did that on these occasions.’

                        ‘eating an odd number of dates on Eid al-Fitr.’
                        
                        Related by al-Bukhari, hadith No. 953
                        
                        4-It is a Sunnah also to walk to the place of the prayer, and to start early, soon after finishing the Fajr prayer, so that one can sit at a convenient place near the imam, and to earn the reward for awaiting the prayer.
                        
                        5- Men are recommended to take a bath before the prayer, wear perfume and put on a fine appearance, wearing some of one’s best clothes. Women are the same, but must not wear perfumes or expose their adornment.
                        
                        6- The imam is recommended to give a comprehensive speech, outlining the main principles of the Islamic faith.
                        
                        7-It is further recommended to say: Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha illa Allah, wallahu Akbar Allahu Akbar walillahi Alhamd.
                        
                        :Allah says in the verse outlining the duty of fasting in Ramadan
                        
                        ‘You are, however, required to complete the necessary number of days and to extol and glorify God for having guided you aright and to tender your thanks.’
                        
                        (2:185)
                        
                        This takbeer is said from the sunset of the last day of Ramadan until the Imam comes out for Eid prayer, and also from the Fajr prayer on the 9th day of Thul Hijjah till the sunset of the 13th of the same month. It is announced after the Fard prayers. Men say their Takbeer (glorifications) aloud, while women recite them in a low voice, if they are in public.
                        
                        8-Changing route. It is recommended to change one’s route, going to the prayer one way and following a different route on the way back. Jabir reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) did that on Eid days. It is said that this is done so that both routes will, on the Day of Judgement, testify for us, or that this special act of worship is shown in different areas.
                        
                        
                        People need to congratulate one another on this occasion, saying to one another: ‘May Allah accept your and my good actions.’ The Prophet’s (peace be upon him)Companions used to do so, showing pleasure to meet other people.`

                        Offering prayers for rain (salaat al-istisqa’) is a Sunnah, as confirmed by saheeh hadeeths and the practice of the early generations of Islam. Ibn Qudaamah said: Prayer for rain is a confirmed Sunnah, proven by the practice of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and of his successors.[1]
                        
                        Abu Dawood (1165), at-Tirmidhi (558), an-Nasaa’i (1506) and Ibn Maajah (1266) narrated that Is-haaq ibn Abdillah ibn Kinaanah said:
                        
                        al-Waleed ibn ‘Uqbah, who was the governor of Madinah, sent me to ask Ibn ‘Abbaas about the prayer of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) for rain (istisqa’). He said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) went out wearing modest clothes, walking humbly and beseeching Allah, until he reached the prayer place, where he ascended the minbar, but he did not give a khutbah like this khutbah of yours; rather he continued to offer supplication (du‘aa’), beseech Allah and recite takbeer, then he prayed two rak‘ahs as he used to pray at Eid
                        
                        Description and recitation
                        The prayer for rain consists of two rak'ahs, similar to Eid prayer.
                        
                        In the first rak'ah, and after the takbeer (glorification), Allah-u akbar, and the opening supplication,  takbeer is repeated seven more times, after that, al-Fatihah and another surah are recited. In the second rak[ah the same takbeer is repeated five times other than the takbeer for standing up from sujood before reciting al-Fatihah.
                        
                        :This is based on the hadith reported by 'A’ishah
                        
                        Allah’s messenger used to say Allah-u akbar in the Eid prayers of al-Fitr and al-Adha seven times in the first rak[ah and five in the second

                        With each takbeer, it is recommended that one raises his hands. Then the imam says silently a'udhu billahi min al-Shaytan al-Rajim (i.e. ‘I seek shelter with Allah against Satan, the accursed.’) He then recites the Qur’an aloud, reciting after al-Fatihah Surah Al A’ala (87) in the first rak[ah and Surah Al Ghashia (88) in the second, as it is reported by Jabir ibn Samurah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) did that. It is also authentically reported that he read Surah Qaf (50) in the first rak[ah and Surah Al Qamar (54) in the second

                        Though this was for Eid prayers but prayer for rian is identical to it. Therefore, it is good to do this in turn, looking always to make things easier for the congregation.`

Then he addressed them and explained to them the reason for the eclipse, and declared their pre-Islamic beliefs to be null and void. He explained to them what they should do, such as praying and making du’aa’ and giving in charity.

                        How it is prayed:
                        Praying it is a communal obligation and it must be prayed in congregation and in the masjid. When the eclipse is visible and can be seen by people, the call is made to gather the Muslims in the mosque. The Imam leads the prayer by offering takbeer, recites the Dua'a in the beginning of the prayer, seeks refuge in Allah from Satan, recites al-Fatiha and then recites a long surah after it. He then bows and prolongs his ruku and then stands straight saying: Sami’a Allahu liman Hamidah, rabana wa lakal Hamd. He then begins to recite al-Fatiha again and another long surah but shorter than the first one. After that, He bows and prolongs his ruku but less than the first one and then stands straight saying: Sami’a Allahu liman Hamidah rabana wa lakal Hamd and prolongs his standing position. He then offers two long prostrations and also prolongs his sitting in between the prostrations. After that, he stands up and repeats the same format as the first rak'ah but shorter. He then sits for tashahud and offers Salam.  
                        
                        Time:
                        The eclipse prayer begins when the eclipse takes place, and should end once it is cleared out. One must not take the predictions of astronomists and pray without seeing it, but rather should only begin prayer once the eclipse is visible. While in prayer, the Imam finishes the prayer either by estimating the time or when someone notifies him.`

                        content: `Janazah prayer is a collective duty. It is performed with the presence of the body of the deceased person in front of the praying people. It consists of standing up, four glorifications, and reciting Al Fatha.

                        It is very important that everyone should always remember death and the end of one’s life in this world, preparing for this eventuality by doing good works, repenting of sin and rectifying injustice, so as to have the right preparation for one’s future, eternal life.
                        
                        
                        It is part of the Sunnah, (recommended actions) to visit people who are ill and remind them of the need to repent of sin and to write their wills. When a person is known to be close to death, it is a Sunnah to remind him to say: La ilaha illa Allah, (i.e. there is no deity other than Allah), so that it is the last thing he says. He shoud not be reminded to say it again unless he speaks something else. If it was the last thing he said before dying, he will go to Paradise as our Prophet (peace be upon him) had told us.[1] When a person dies, it is recommended to close his eyes and to take steps to prepare him for burial and bury him without delay.
                        
                        Status: 
                        
                        The prayer for a deceased person is a collective duty,(fard kifaayah), which means that it must be done by some people, and when it is done, those who did not attend it are absolved of the responsibility. The basis of this verdict is the fact that when the body of a deceased person was brought in the mosque and he had some debt outstanding,

                        Conditions:
                        
                        The conditions for the validity of the janazah prayer are the same as the conditions of prayer mentioned earlier, with the exception that it is not time-bound and that the body of the deceased must be present in front of the people offering the prayer. Moreover, both the deceased and the one offering the prayer should be Muslims, and they should both  be in a state of purification, even if it be dry ablution when there is need for it.
                        
                        
                        Essentials:
                        
                         The people offering the prayer for the deceased should stand up, as this is a prayer and standing up is required in all prayers. It consists of four takbeer (glorifications), i.e. Allah-u akbar, 
                        
                        ‘because the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered it for the Negus with four takbeer.’

                         Other essentials are reciting al-Fatihah, because the hadith that mentions that no prayer is valid without reciting al-Fatihah applies to all prayers;
                        
                        blessing the Prophet (peace be upon him); supplication for the deceased as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘When you pray for a deceased person, make your supplication sincere.’

                         finishing with salam, because the hadith that makes salam the end of prayer also applies; and doing these essentials in the right order.
                        
                        
                        Recommended practices
                        
                        
                        It is recommended to raise the hands with every one of the four takbeer (glorifications) to say A'udhu billahi min al-Shaytan al-Rajim, before reciting al-Fatihah; to include oneself and all Muslims in one’s supplication; and to say all this quietly, not audibly.[2]
                        
                         Time: 
                        
                        The time to offer the janazah prayer starts after having washed the body of the deceased, wrapped and prepared him or her for burial. If one misses the congregational prayer, he can offer it at the cemetery.
                        
                        Importance: 
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘Whoever takes part in a funeral until the janazah prayer has been offered shall have a share of the reward, and whoever takes part until the deceased has been buried shall have two shares.People asked: ‘What are these shares?’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: They are like two huge mountains.’

                        How it is done
                        
                        1. The imam, or the person who is offering the prayer alone, stands close to the head of the deceased male, or near the middle of the body of the deceased female, as Anas reported the Prophet (peace be upon him) did that.
                        
                        2. He then says Allah-u akbar to start the prayer, and follows this with a'udhu billahi min al-Shaytan al-Rajim, then recites al-Fatihah silently, even when the prayer is offered at night.
                        
                        3. Then the imam says the second Allah-u akbar, and follows it with sending the Ibrahimic salutation to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as said at the end of every normal prayer.
                        
                        4. Then he says the third takbeer and follows it with supplications for the deceased. There are supplications said by the Prophet (peace be upon him) on such occasions, such as:
                        
                        a. ‘Our Lord, forgive us all: the living and the dead; the present and the absent; the young and the old; the males and the females. Our Lord, whoever of us You keep alive enable them to live as Muslims, and those of us whose souls You gather let them end their lives as believers.’
                        
                        b. Other supplications for the deceased include:
                        
                        ‘My Lord, forgive him (or her); bestow mercy on him and wipe his sins; bless his place and widen his entrance; wash him with water, snow and hail; clear him of sins as stains are removed from a white robe; place him in a home better than his home, and give him a family better than his family, and a spouse better than his spouse. Admit him into heaven and shelter him from torment in the grave and punishment in hell.’

                        If one joins the prayer after it has started, he completes the prayer after the imam has finished. If one misses the prayer before the deceased is buried, one may go to the grave and pray the janazah prayer there, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did when he was informed that the cleaner who used to look after the mosque had died. He went to her grave and prayed there.[3]
                        
                        If the deceased is in a different town, one may offer the janazah prayer on being informed of his death, even if this happens a month or more later.[4] If a woman has a miscarriage, the janazah prayer is offered for the aborted embryo if the pregnancy was more than four months.though some scholars validate the janazah for a fetus as young as forty days, based on more than one statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him).`

                        name: 'Fasting',
                        content: `Fasting is not an act that is meant to torture you. In fact, it is one of the most meaningful forms of worship that Allah has asked us to perform whenever we can. It is the easiest way to see the world differently.  
                        Linguistically speaking, fasting means abstention from something. In an Islamic context, it means intentional abstention from eating and drinking, as well as all that invalidates fasting, from the break of dawn until sunset with the intention of worshipping Allah.[1]
                        
                        
                        The spiritual concept of fasting
                        
                        1-Fasting is a means of expressing one’s gratitude for Allah’s blessings. It stops a person from eating, drinking and sex, which are some of Allah’s great blessings. To refrain from them for a considerable time is to show one’s appreciation of these blessings. An aspect of Allah’s grace may be taken for granted, or people may be oblivious to it, until it is denied, and people will then know its importance. They will then recognize Allah’s grace and feel grateful for it. To express gratitude for Allah’s blessings is a duty that is required logically and from the Islamic viewpoint. 
                        
                        Allah refers to it in the verse that imposes the duty of fasting the month of Ramadan:
                        
                        
                        
                        ‘telling us that the fulfilment of this duty is the way ‘to tender your thanks.’
                        
                        (2:185)
                        
                        2-Fasting is a means to maintain a God-fearing attitude. When a person abstains from what is lawful in order to please Allah and in fear of His punishment, that person willingly refrains from what is forbidden. This means that fasting leads one to steer away from what Allah has prohibited. Fasting is indeed made a duty for us in order to nurture this feeling of fearing Allah,
                        
                        :as He says
                        
                        ‘Believers, fasting is decreed for you as it was decreed for those before you, so that you may be God-fearing.’
                        
                        (2:183)
                        
                        3-Fasting overcomes desire. When man eats a full meal, he thinks of satisfying other desires. When he is hungry, other desires take a secondary place in his interests.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) advises young people saying
                        
                        ‘Young men, whoever of you can afford marriage should get married, because marriage will help him lower his gaze and maintain his chastity. The one who is unable to get married may fast, as fasting provides protection [against sin].’

                        This shows that fasting is a means that helps man to refrain from sin.[2]
                        
                        4-Fasting encourages people to be compassionate and kind to those who are in need. When a person fasts and experiences hunger for a long time he will remember his feelings and he will be more willing to be charitable to people who are poor and in need of help. His kindness to such people will earn him rich reward from Allah.
                        
                        5-Fasting puts the rich and the poor on the same level, as they will all bear the same pain of hunger. This increases one’s reward.[3]
                        
                        6-Fasting helps to overcome the temptation presented by Satan, who exploits human desires to lead people away from Allah’s path, and such desires are always stronger when one eats and drinks.
                        
                        :Safiyyah reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘Satan has his way with a human being like his own blood.’

                        7-Fasting helps man to disregard the fleeting pleasures of this life and to look for the lasting happiness in the life to come.
                        
                        
                        Conditions: The following conditions must apply for the duty of fasting to be valid:
                        
                        1-Being a Muslim: Fasting is not valid if it is done by an unbeliever. It is an act of worship, and worship cannot be offered by an unbeliever. When an unbeliever embraces Islam, he or she is not required to fast for previous years.
                        
                        2-Puberty: Fasting is not required of anyone who has not attained the age when Islamic worship applies, which is the attainment of puberty.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) says
                        
                        ‘Three are exempt from duties.’

                        One of these is a child until attaining puberty. However, if a child below this age understands actions and requirements and fasts, that fast is accepted. Fathers and guardians will do well to encourage such children to fast so as to be familiar with fasting.
                        
                        3-Sanity: Fasting is not required of an insane or mentally disabled person.
                        
                        4-Sound health: A person who is ill and cannot fast is not required to fast. However, if he or she fasts, their fast is valid.
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘He who is ill or on a journey shall fast instead the same number of days later on.’
                        
                        (2:185)
                        
                        When a person who is ill in Ramadan recovers and is back in good health, he should compensate for not fasting during his illness by fasting the same number of days that were missed.
                        
                        5-Being in one’s place of residence: A person who is on a journey is not required to fast. However, if he or she fasts, their fast is valid. 
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘He who is ill or on a journey shall fast instead the same number of days later on.’
                        
                        (2:185)
                        
                        When a person who undertakes a journey in Ramadan, and avails himself of the concession not to fast, is back in his hometown, he should compensate for not fasting during his travel by fasting the same number of days.
                        
                        6-Women who are in their period or having postnatal bleeding may not fast. In fact fasting is prohibited for women during the menstrual and postnatal periods.The Prophet  (peace be upon him) stated this clearly.[4]
                        
                         However, they must fast the same number of days later.
                        
                        :A’ishah said
                        
                        ‘We used to have these periods and we were ordered to fast in compensation, but no compensation for prayer was required.’

                        Essentials: rukns. The first is the abstention from anything that invalidates fasting from the break of dawn until sunset. This is based on the Qur’anic verse that includes
                        
                        ‘Eat and drink until you can see the white streak of dawn against the blackness of the night. Then resume the fast till nightfall.’
                        
                        (2:187)
                        
                         The second rukn is that a person intends this abstention as an act of worship. It is intention that distinguishes whether a particular deed is one of worship or an ordinary action. Intention also distinguishes between acts of worship. A fast may be an obligatory worship, as in the case of fasting in Ramadan, or it may be a different fast. This rukn is based on the hadith in which
                        
                        :the Prophet (peace be upon him) says
                        
                        ‘Actions are but by intention and every person shall have but that which he intended.’

This means that the obligation of fasting is confirmed by the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the unanimity of Muslims. Muslims also unanimously agree that anyone who denies it is an unbeliever`

                        content: `What is more important than fasting is forming the intention. Muslims are obliged to form the intention and it must be formed before dawn. If the fasting is voluntary it is acceptable to form it during the day.

                        A person who fasts must intend to fast, for the intention is a rukn of fasting as the Prophet (peace be upon him) says: ‘Actions are but by intention.’
                        
                        Every person shall have but that which he has intended.’ In obligatory fasting, such as the fasting in Ramadan, atonement for some misdeed, compensatory fasting or pledged fasting, the intention should be formed during the night, before the break of dawn even by seconds.
                        
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) says: ‘A person who has not intended to fast before dawn renders his fast invalid.’

                        If during the day, having not eaten or drunk anything since dawn, a person forms the intention to fast that day, it will be acceptable only if that fasting is voluntary.
                        
                        A’ishah reports: ‘The Prophet (peace be upon him) came in one day and asked: “Have you got anything (to eat)?” We said: “No.” He said: Then, I am fasting.’

                         On the other hand, obligatory fasting cannot be started with an intention formed during the day. The intention in obligatory fasting must be formed during the night, before dawn. It is sufficient to form the intention on the start of Ramadan for the whole month providing he doesn’t miss a day in between.

                        content: `Allah the most merciful has exempted some people from fasting in Ramadan. Some cases like; sick, old people, or travelers. And they have to make up for those days later and give compensation to the poor and needy.  

                        1- Illness and old age: A person who is ill and hopes to recover good health may not fast during the days when he is ill. When he is back in health he must fast the same number of days he did not fast in Ramadan, during the following eleven months.
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘[Fast] on a certain number of days. But whoever of you is ill, or on a journey, shall fast instead the same number of days later on.’
                        
                        (2:184)
                        
                        :He also says
                        
                        ‘So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast; and whoever is ill or on a journey then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.’ (2:185)
                        
                        The type of illness that gives the exemption from fasting is one which makes fasting hard.
                        
                        A person suffering a chronic illness with little or no hope of recovery, and one who is permanently unable to fast such as a frail, elderly person, need not fast and are not required to fast later. What they are required to do is to give compensation in the form of feeding a poor person for every day when they did not fast. In the early days of Islam, when fasting was made a duty, Muslims were given the choice of either to fast or to feed one poor person for the day. Thus, Allah made the feeding of a poor person equal to fasting. This remains the case when exemption is permanent.
                        
                        Imam al-Bukhari mentions in his anthology of authentic hadiths: ‘Al-Hasan and Ibrahim mentioned that an elderly person who finds fasting too hard may feed a poor person. Anas did that for a year or two when he was too old: he fed a poor person in compensation for every day he could not fast.
                        
                        Regarding an elderly man or woman who finds fasting too hard,
                        
                        Ibn ' Abbas said: ‘Each should feed one poor person in compensation for every day of fasting.’
                        
                        Related by al-Bukhari, hadith No. 4,505
                        
                        Thus, a person who is permanently unable to fast, either because of a chronic illness or being elderly, should compensate for non-fasting by feeding a poor person. Scholars used to estimate that by a measure equal to 1.125 kilogram of wheat, rice, dates or the staple diet of one’s town. However, it is better to say that feeding a poor person should be of what one usually feeds his family,
                        
                        as Allah says in regard to the compensation of a broken oath: ‘The breaking of an oath must be atoned for by the feeding of 10 needy persons with more or less the same food as you normally give to your own families, or by clothing them, or by the freeing of one slave. He who cannot afford any of these shall fast three days instead.’ (5:89)
                        
                         If an ill person fasts, his fasting is valid. 
                        
                        2-Travel: A person on a journey is given the concession that he does not need to fast in Ramadan, but he must compensate for it by fasting the same number of days he did not fast during his travel.
                        
                        Allah says: ‘[Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill, or on a journey,[during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up].’ (2:184)
                        
                         He also says: ‘So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast; and whoever is ill or on a journey then an equal number of other days.’ (2:185)
                        
                        Someone asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about fasting during travel. He answered
                        
                        ‘If you wish you may fast, and you may not fast if you wish.’

                        Exemption from fasting is applicable to travel that covers a distance similar to that which allows shortening prayers.[2] This is estimated at about 80 kilometres. Another way of gauging it is according to what Muslims there consider as travelling.Moreover, travel must be for a legitimate purpose. If it is undertaken in order to commit a sinful action, or to dodge fasting, the exemption does not apply.
                        
                        If a traveller choose to fast, his fasting is valid.
                        
                        Anas reports: ‘We used to travel with Allah’s messenger, and a fasting person did not press an advantage against one who did not fast, nor did the one who was not fasting claim that he was doing better.’

                         It is a condition for fasting during travel that fasting should not cause hardship. If the person concerned finds fasting too hard or harmful, then it becomes prohibited and sinful to fast during travel. During his travel, the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man who was being given covering shade because it was too hot, and people gathered around him. When he was informed that the person was fasting,
                        
                        the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ‘It is not an act of righteousness to fast when travelling.’

                        3-Menstruation: When a woman is in her menstrual period, or having postnatal bleeding, she must not fast. In fact, if she fasts, her fast is invalid. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri mentions that the Prophet (peace be upon him) clearly stated that a woman in menstruation may neither pray nor fast. She is required to compensate by fasting later on. 'A’ishah said: ‘It happened to us and we were ordered to fast later in compensation, but not to compensate for missed prayers.’
                        
                        4-Pregnancy and breastfeeding. A woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding and fears for herself or her child as a result of fasting, may not fast.
                        
                        Anas reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
                        
                        ‘Allah has reduced a traveller’s prayer by half and exempted him from fasting, and He has exempted pregnant and breastfeeding women from fasting.’

                         Both pregnant and breastfeeding women must compensate for not fasting by fasting a similar number of days later on, or they can feed a poor person for each day they do not fast.
                        
                        Ibn 'Abbas said: ‘If a breastfeeding or a pregnant woman fears for her child, she does not fast, but she feeds a poor person.’

                        content: `There are some acts that invalidate Muslims fasting and they must be aware of.  These acts include; to eat, drink, having sexual intercourse, forcing oneself to vomit, cupping, or fasting during menstruation.

                        A fasting person invalidates his fast by any of the following actions:
                        
                        1-Eating or drinking deliberately:
                        
                        Allah says: ‘And eat and drink until the white of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then resume the fast till nightfall.’ (2:187)
                        
                        Furthermore, anything that takes the place of eating and/or drinking shares the same ruling and invalidates fasting. For example, receiving intravenous fluids takes the place of food and drink, because it nourishes the body the same as food and drink.
                        
                        2-Sexual intercourse: Whoever has sexual intercourse with his wife when fasting, their fast is invalidated. The person who thus invalidates his fast during Ramadan is required to repent for having committed this sinful action, seek Allah’s forgiveness, fast a day in compensation for this invalidated day and further expiate his wrong by freeing a slave from bondage. If this is unavailable or unaffordable, then the expiation takes the form of fasting two consecutive months. If the offender is unable to fast two months, then he feeds 60 poor people. 
                        
                        Abu Hurayrah reports:
                        
                        ‘We were sitting with Allah’s messenger when a man came in and said ‘O Messenger of Allah, I am ruined.” The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked him: “What have you done to be ruined?” He said: “I had intercourse with my wife when I was fasting (in Ramadan).” The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked him: “Can you afford to free a slave?” The man said he could not. The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked: “Can you, then, fast two consecutive months?” The man said: “No.” The Prophet  (peace be upon him) asked: “Can you feed 60 poor people?” The man again said: “No.” The Prophet (peace be upon him) waited. Then as we were still with the Prophet (peace be upon him), he was brought a sack of dates. He asked: “Where is the man who asked me earlier?” The man identified himself. The Prophet  (peace be upon him) said: “Take this and give it away to charity.” The man said: “Shall I give it to anyone poorer than me, Messenger of Allah? By Allah, there is not in between the two sides of Madinah a household that is poorer than my own family.” The Prophet (peace be upon him) smiled widely, then said: Feed your family with it.’

                        Related to this, fasting is invalidated by deliberate ejaculation, as in the case of masturbation or foreplay leading to ejaculation. All this counts as deliberate arousal and this is contrary to fasting. In such a case, the person who does any of these must compensate by repenting and fasting a day after Ramadan. There is no other expiation required, because such expiation is binding only in the case of the man having sexual intercourse with his wife.
                        
                        3-Deliberate vomiting: This means deliberately throwing up whatever is in one’s stomach of food or drink. If it happens unintentionally, the fast remains valid.
                        
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
                        
                        Whoever throws up unintentionally need not compensate for his fast, but the one who throws up deliberately must repeat his fast.’

                        as the Prophet (peace be upon him) says: ‘Both the cupping and the cupped persons break their fast.’

                         The person administering the cupping also invalidates his fast if he sucks the blood with his mouth, but if the sucking is done by some tools, then his fast remains valid.
                        
                        5-Menstruation and postnatal bleeding: When a woman begins her menses, or her postnatal period, her fast is invalidated. She must compensate by fasting later.
                        
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ‘Is it not true that when she has the period, she neither prays nor fasts?.’

Intention is one of two essentials for the validity of fasting. If it is broken, with the intention to end the fast, the fast is broken.

                         This verse makes clear that it was an approved practice in earlier faiths.
                        
                        Allah also says in the verse explaining rulings applicable to fasting:
                        
                        ‘And do not have relations with them (your wives) as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques.’(2:187)
                        
                        
                        A’ishah reports that:
                        
                        ‘the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to spend the last ten days of Ramadan in seclusion in the mosque, until he passed away.’

                        All Muslims agree that it is an aspect of Islam and that it is a Sunnah which becomes binding only if a man commits himself to it by making a pledge to do it. 
                        
                        Thus the fact that i' tikaf is a Sunnah is confirmed by the Qur’an, the hadith and the unanimity of scholars.
                        Islam recommends Muslims to practise this Sunnah and stay in the mosque in the last 10 nights of Ramadan when they should devote more of their time to worship. The Prophet’s (peace be upon him) practice in these 10 nights was to devote all his time to worship, staying up every night, eager to be attending to his worship on the Night of Decree which falls in one of these 10 nights. The Night of Power is a night of great significance, including:
                        
                        It is the night when the Qur’an was bestowed.
                        ‘Indeed, We sent the Qur'an down during the Night of Decree.’ (97:1)
                        
                        On this night Allah determines everything that takes place in the year ahead:
                        ‘On that night is made distinct every precise matter. [Every] matter [proceeding] from Us. Indeed, We were to send [a messenger].’ (44:4-5)
                        
                        This is a sub-decree, because Allah had determined everything more than 50,000 years before creation. However, on this night Allah determines what happens to His creation during the following year: who will survive and who will die; the saved and the ruined; the happy and the miserable; the powerful and the humiliated. Whatever Allah wishes to happen during the following year is written down on this Night of Decree.
                        It is a blessed night
                        :as Allah says
                        
                        ‘Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night.’ (44:3)
                        
                        Worship on this night is better rewarded than worship over one thousand months,
                        :as Allah says
                        
                        ‘The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months.’ (97:1)
                        
                        This means that worship on the Night of Decree is better rewarded than worship for a thousand months without the Night of Decree, which is equal to 83 years and three months.
                        The angel Gabriel and other angels descend with blessings, goodness and forgiveness on that night,
                        :as Allah has stated
                        
                        ‘On that night, the angels and the Spirit, by their Lord’s leave, descend with all His decrees.’ (97:4)
                        
                        The Night of Decree is a night of peace,
                        
                        :as Allah says
                        
                        ‘That night is peace, till the break of dawn.’
                        
                        (97:5)
                        
                        It is a night that is free of evil and harm, when a great deal of worship and good actions are dedicated to Allah’s pleasure. Hence, it is all peace.
                        
                        :Abu Hurayrah reports that the Prophet  (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘Whoever stands in prayer the Night of Decree in worship sincerely dedicating such worship for Allah’s pleasure shall be forgiven their past sins.’

                        Abu Hurayrah reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
                        
                        ‘Allah says: Fasting is Mine and it is I who give reward for it. Fasting is protection. On a fasting day, do not engage in wickedness or quarrelsome behaviour. If someone abuses or fights him (i.e. a fasting person), let him say: “I am fasting.” By Him who holds Muhammad’s soul in His hand, the smell of the mouth of a fasting person is better in Allah’s sight than the smell of musk. A fasting person has two occasions to rejoice: when he breaks his fast he rejoices and when he meets his Lord, he will rejoice for having fasted.’

                        Linguistically speaking, the Arabic word zakat signifies growth and increase. In Islamic contexts it refers to a duty imposed on money that exceeds a certain threshold, bound by time, and is payable to specific groups.[1]

                        1-Islam: Zakat is not accepted from unbelievers in Islam, because it is a financial worship which brings a Muslim closer to Allah. No worship is acceptable from an unbeliever until he or she embraces Islam.

                        ‘Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy, and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah.

                        To give more details about these classes:[1]
                        
                        1-The poor: A poor person is one who does not have enough to meet his and his dependants’ needs of food, drink, clothes and home. He may have nothing, or may not have enough. He is given what meets his needs for a full year.
                        
                        2-The needy: A needy person is one who gets half what he needs for living, or even more than half. He is given out of zakat funds what he needs for a year.
                        
                        3- Administrative workers: This refers to anyone assigned by the Muslim ruler to collect zakat. The ruler gives him what he needs during his travel until he returns, even though he may be rich. This is because such a person devotes his time to this work. The administrative workers include all those who are given the tasks of collecting, recording, safeguarding and distribution of zakat to its rightful beneficiaries. This certainly applied when Muslim governments undertook the collection and distribution of zakat, however, in modern times most, if not all, Muslim governments have abandoned this duty. However, there are many civil and charitable organizations which have taken on this responsibility and undertake this duty. These may deduct from what they collect of zakat money to pay to their staff, who are employed for this task. However, they may not pay zakat money except for their work in the administration of zakat. If a member of staff works only half of his working hours on zakat duties, while the other half is devoted to other aspects of his employment, he may be paid only half his salary out of zakat funds.
                        
                        4- Those whose hearts are to be won over: These are people who may be unbelievers and they are given money out of zakat to win their goodwill towards Islam, or they may be Muslims but not very strong in faith, or they are people who have non-Muslim relatives who need to be encouraged to look favourably at Islam, or whose help is needed, etc.
                        
                        5-The freeing of people in bondage: This refers to Muslim slaves who may be bought to give them their freedom. Their price may be paid out of zakat funds. Alternatively, a slave might have agreed a deal to buy his own freedom, and he or she is given what helps them to complete the deal and buy their freedom. This enables slaves to be good members of society, able to conduct their own affairs and to serve Allah’s cause as best as they can. The same applies to pay ransom to free Muslim captives taken by the enemy.
                        
                        6-Debtors: This applies to a person who has incurred a debt for a legitimate purpose, whether it is for personal reasons or to help others. Debtors are given from the zakat funds what helps them to repay their debts. If someone incurred a debt to pay for the reconciliation of quarrelling parties, he is helped with zakat funds, even though he may be wealthy.
                        
                        7-To further Allah’s cause: This applies to fighters for Allah’s cause who volunteer to join the Muslim army and they have no salary. They are given money from zakat, even though they may not be in need.
                        
                        8- The traveller in need:This refers to a traveller who is unable to continue his journey to his place of residence. He may not be able to borrow what he needs, so he is given from zakat what he needs for his journey home.

If a member of staff works only half of his working hours on zakat duties, while the other half is devoted to other aspects of his employment, he may be paid only half his salary out of zakat funds.

                        content: `Zakat isn't a must in 6 classes of people; those who can earn their living, offspring, wives, ancestors, unbelievers, prophet's descendants, and slaves. It isn't necessary to satisfy the 8 zakat deservers.


                        1-People in money and those able to earn their living:
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘There is no share in zakat for anyone who has plenty or who is able to earn his living ’ 
                        
                        Related by Ahmad, vol. 5, p. 362; Abu Dawud, hadith No. 1,633; al-Nassa’i, vol. 5, p. 99
                        
                        However, a person with sufficient means, or a rich person, may be given out of zakat if they qualify as zakat administrators or debtors. Likewise, the one who is able to earn one’s living may be given zakat money if he is studying full time, provided that he studies either Islamic studies or a discipline needed by the Muslim community. The pursuit of such studies is akin to fighting for Allah’s cause. On the other hand if a person is able to earn one’s living but does not work in order to devote his time to worship, he may not be given zakat money. Such worship is voluntary and, at best, recommended. Unlike knowledge, worship benefits the worshipper only while knowledge benefits him and others.
                        
                        2-Offspring, ancestors and wives: These are relatives that a man has a duty to look after. Whatever they need for their living is his responsibility. Therefore, it is not permissible to pay one’s zakat to one’s parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren or wives. To pay zakat to them reduces his liability towards them or makes them independent. As such, he would be like one paying his zakat to himself.However, it is permissible for a wife to give her zakat to her husband if he is poor, needy or in debt he can't pay off.
                        
                        3-Unbelievers who do not belong to those whose hearts are to be won over: It is not permissible to pay zakat to unbelievers,
                        
                        :as the Prophet (peace be upon him) says
                        
                         ‘ It is taken from the rich among them and paid to their poor’  
                        
                        The Prophet was referring to the rich among the Muslims and their poor. One of the main objectives of zakat is to make those Muslims who are poor self-sufficient, and to strengthen the ties of love and brotherhood within the Muslim community. 
                        
                        4-The Prophet’s (peace be upon him) descendents: Zakat may not be paid to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) descendents. This is out of respect to the Prophet and his household and because they have a portion to be paid to them from the spoils of war as mentioned in 8:41 “And know that anything you obtain of the spoils of war – then indeed, for Allah is one fifth of it and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives and the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveler”.The Prophet (peace be upon him) says:
                        
                        
                        
                        ‘Charity is not to be paid to members of Muhammad’s household: it is people’s dirt’ 
                        
                        Related by Muslim, hadith No. 1,072. This is a reference to the fact that zakat is meant to purify people and ensure their forgiveness. As such, it is like the water that washes dirt off people’s clothes
                        
                        Members of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) household are said by some scholars to be the descendants of the clans of Hashim and al-Muttalib. Other scholars limit them to the Hashim clan, which means that zakat may be paid to the descendants of the al-Muttalib clan. This is the weightier view. 
                        
                        5-The slaves freed by members of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) household: 
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) says
                        
                        ‘Charitable donation is not permissible for us; and the slaves that are freed by any people belong to their community’ 
                        
                        Related by Abu Dawud, hadith No. 1,650; al-Tirmidhi, hadith No. 657; al-Hakim, vol. 1, p. 651
                        
                        6-Slaves: Zakat may not be paid to a slave, except one who has made an agreement with his master to buy his own freedom. He is paid zakat money to help him pay for his freedom.
                        
                        
                        Anyone who pays zakat to any of these classes, knowing that it is not payable to them, this is considered as a charity and he still has to pay his zakat to those who are worthy of receiving it.[1]
                        
                        It is not necessary to satisfy all eight classes of beneficiaries when distributing the zakat funds. It is perfectly permissible to pay all the zakat funds to one only of these classes.
                        
                        :Allah says
                        
                        ‘If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you, and He will remove from you some of your misdeeds [thereby].’
                        
                        (2:271)
                        
                        As we have noted, the Prophet (peace be upon him) defined zakat as a donation ‘to be taken from the rich among them and given to their poor.’ Moreover, Qabisah ibn Mukhariq undertook to pay the costs of sorting out a dispute between some of his people. He went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) to request help in this payment.
                        
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him:
                        
                        ‘Stay with us until we receive some zakat and we will pay it to you’ 
                        Related by Muslim, hadith No. 1,044
                        
                        These statements show that the Qur’anic verse stating the classes of beneficiaries of zakat only indicates these who may benefit by zakat, but does not imply that all of them must share it out.`

If he fights to withhold it, he is fought until he submits to Allah’s command and pays his zakat.

                        If the borrower is facing hardship and cannot repay the debt, the lender pays zakat for the loan once it is repaid. If it had been with the borrower for several years, the lender pays its zakat for one year only. On the other hand, if the loan is given to someone who has money and is able to repay it, its zakat is due on the lender every year, because financial instruments being with someone able to repay them is like its being with the lender.

                        content: `Zakat must be paid on gold and silver. An amount of 2.5 percent is required to be paid but there are some conditions that should be met like; ownership of the threshold, full ownership and the turn of a year.

                        Zakat is payable on gold and silver, which were the standard currencies for long periods of history,
                        
                        :as Allah says
                        
                        ‘To those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend them in Allah’s cause, give the news of a painful suffering.’
                        
                        (9:34)
                        
                         Needless to say, such warnings are given only in the case of neglecting a duty. As we noted, the Prophet (peace be upon him)  says: ‘Anyone who owns gold or silver but does not pay out their dues shall come on the Day of Judgement when plates  of fire shall be made ready for him, and they will be heated in hell then his forehead, side and back shall be branded with them. When they cool down, they will be reheated. That day is as long as 50 thousand years, until Allah has judged between His servants.’ Furthermore, scholars are unanimous that if one owns 200 dirhams (i.e. the silver currency), he pays five dirhams annually in zakat, and if one owns 20 weights or dinars (i.e. gold currency), then zakat is payable on that gold.
                        
                        
                        What is due on gold and silver
                        
                        The zakat payable on gold and silver is 2.5 %, which means that for 20 dinars (a dinar was the gold currency) half a dinar is payable. For any little or great amount above that the same rate of 2.5 % applies. Likewise, for 200 dirhams of silver five dirhams are payable, and for any greater amount the same rate applies.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) says
                        
                        ‘On silver the payable zakat is a quarter of one tenth.’

                        For zakat to be payable on gold and silver, the following conditions must apply:
                        
                        1-Ownership of the threshold of zakat, which is 20 weights or dinars of gold.
                        
                        :The hadith reported by ' Ali quotes the Prophet (peace be upon him) as saying
                        
                        ‘In the case of gold, you have nothing to pay until you own 20 dinars. If you have 20 dinars and you have had it for a year, the duty is to pay half a dinar.’

                         and this threshold is estimated to be equivalent to 85 grams. The threshold for silver is 200 dirhams,
                        
                        :as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said
                        
                        ‘No zakat is due on any amount less than five ounces.’

                        and the ounce is equal to 40 dirhams. Thus the threshold is equivalent to 200 dirhams., which is equivalent now to 595 grams of silver.
                        
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) says:
                        
                        ‘On silver the payable zakat is a quarter of one tenth. If one has only 199 dirhams, then no duty is payable.’
                        
                        2- The passing of one lunar year with the gold or silver in possession of a Muslim. If a person has the threshold of gold or silver for less than one year, there is no zakat on it.
                        
                        
                        Combining gold and silver
                        
                        The weightier view is that gold and silver are not counted together in calculating the threshold of zakat because they are two different kinds of precious metals. Therefore, they are treated like different kinds of other possessions, such as in the case of camels and cows, or barley and wheat.`

                        This hadith is definitive on this question and is supported by another hadith in authentic anthologies.
                        Some scholars have discussed at length the difference of opinion among scholars on this issue, arriving at the following conclusions:
                        
                        1-Zakat is payable on jewellery kept as savings or for investment. The same applies to jewellery kept for personal use if the use is forbidden, such as gold and silver plates and cutlery, or gold jewellery for men, or women’s jewellery that is clearly excessive.
                        
                        2-Zakat is not payable on jewellery kept for permissible use, such as women’s jewellery – within reasonable limits – and a man’s silver ring, as it cannot grow. Moreover, it is an article of personal need, like one’s clothes and furniture.
                        
                        3-The same applies to permissible jewellery owned by a woman who wears or lends it freely, or is owned by a man for his family’s use or who lends it.
                        
                        4-Jewellery and other gold and silver articles that are liable to zakat pay 2.5% annually in zakat, together with the person’s other property, if any.
                        
                        5-It is a condition for zakat payable on such jewellery that the jewellery is, in itself or together with the person’s other zakatable property, above the threshold of zakat, i.e. 85 grams of gold. In arriving at this figure, the value is considered, not the weight, because there is an added value for the manufacture of the jewellery

                        Undoubtedly, commercial commodities represent money and are possessions.
                        
                        Conditions applicable to commercial commodities
                        
                        1-Their ownership.
                        
                        2-They should be owned with the intention of trading. If a person inherits and sells what he inherited, there is no zakat on it as he sold it to get rid of it and not to invest it again. If he sold it to reinvest it again, this means he has to begin calculating zakat from the moment his intention changed to trading.
                        
                        3-Their value should be equivalent to, or more than, the threshold of zakat.
                        
                        4-The turn of a lunar year over the commercial commodities and their price. Usually, this is marked by the beginning date of such trading. On that particular day, the trader calculates the value of the merchandise in addition to the cash he has and gives 2.5% as zakat.
                        
                        
                        Moreover, the five conditions we have mentioned at the beginning of this chapter also apply to commercial commodities. When a year has turned, their value is estimated. If their total value is more than the threshold of zakat, a duty of 2.5 per cent is payable in zakat. In calculating the value of commercial commodities, the purchase price is not taken into account. They should be valued at the time when zakat is payable, i.e. at the turn of a year, because the value of any commercial goods may vary from time to time.

                        Zakat is payable on what is produced from the earth, as is clearly stated in the Qur’anic verse:

                         Zakat becomes due when grains are fully grown, and in other types when they appear to be good and may be eaten. On such produce the condition of the turn of the year does not apply, because Allah says:

                        Zakat is payable on all kinds of produce that are measured by volume and can be stored, such as wheat, barley, corn, rice, dates, raisins etc. It is not due on fruits and vegetables, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned packing as a criterion and storage, which fits with the general perspective of zakat.[1]
                        
                        
                        Fruits, vegetables and other agricultural produce that are prepared for immediate sale are liable to zakat not as products of earth but as commercial goods.
                        
                        
                        Conditions: Two conditions should be met to make zakat payable for agricultural produce:
                        
                        1-The produce should be equivalent to, or more than, the threshold, which is five measures defined by the Prophet (peace be upon him). This is equivalent in our present day measures to 612 kilograms of grain.
                        
                        :The Prophet (peace be upon him) says
                        
                        ‘No zakat is due for what is less than five wisqs ’
                        
                        Related by al-Bukhari, hadith No. 1,405; Muslim, hadith No. 979. A wisq is a volume measure estimated to be equal to 122 kilograms
                        
                        2-The owner should own the threshold of zakat at the time when zakat is due.
                        
                        The amount payable
                        
                        
                        For agricultural produce that is irrigated without cost, such as that irrigated by rain or natural springs, the zakat duty is 10 %, while if irrigation depends on labour and machines, the duty is 5 %. This is based on the hadith that says:
                        
                        ‘For what is irrigated by rain, rivers and springs, or does not need irrigation, the zakat is one tenth, and for what is irrigated by camels, the zakat is half of one tenth ’

                        Honey
                        
                        The majority of scholars are of the view that no zakat is payable for honey. This appears to be the case because there is no clear statement in the Qur’an or the Sunnah mentioning it. The rule is that unless there is evidence to state an obligation, then no obligation exists. Imam al-Shafi'i said: ‘The hadith that mentions that one tenth is levied on honey is poor in authenticity, as is the other report, except for what is mentioned by ' Umar ibn ' Abd al-' Aziz. My view is that no zakat is payable for honey. There are confirmed reports and hadiths stating the types that are liable to zakat, but we have no confirmed report concerning honey. This suggests that it is not required.
                        
                         Ibn al-Mundhir said: ‘There is no report that stands to proper examination concerning the payment of zakat on honey.[2]
                        Zakat on rikaz
                        
                        Rikaz refers to whatever is found of gold, silver, or anything else that bears the sign of Islamic era which was buried by unbelievers and does not require much labour or great expense to recover. If it requires expense and labour to recover, then it is not rikaz.[3]One fifth of it, whatever the quantity, is paid as zakat. The conditions of meeting the threshold of zakat and the turn of the year do not apply to rikaz. The Prophet’s (peace be upon him) hadith is very general, as he says:
                        
                        ‘One fifth is due on rikaz ’

                        Rikaz is used to pay for the national interests of the Muslim community. It may be of any type, not necessarily gold or silver.

As we have already noted, minerals are subject to zakat according to the majority of scholars. Their view is based on the fact that statements referring to what the earth yields are general and cover all mineral resources, as mentioned in the Qur’anic verse that says: 
                        
                        ‘Believers, spend on others out of the good things you have earned, and out of that which We bring forth for you from the earth ’(2:267)`

                         If the cattle graze for a short period during the year and are fed for most of it, then no zakat is payable for them.
                        
                        4-The cattle should not be used for purposes like tilling the earth or carrying goods, because such animals are considered to be among man’s essential needs like clothes. If the animals are hired to other people, the income is liable to zakat at the turn of the year.
                        
                        
                        The payable duty
                        
                        
                        For camels: For five camels, a one-year-old sheep or a two-year-old goat is due. For 10 camels two sheep; for 15 camels three sheep and four sheep are due for 20 camels. For any number between 25 and 35 camels a one-year-old she-camel is due. If the owner cannot find such a she-camel, then a two-year-old male camel suffices. If there are between 36 and 45 camels, a two-year-old she-camel is due. For 46-60 camels, a three-year-old she-camel is due. For 61-75 camels, a four-year-old she-camel is due. For 76-90 camels, two 2-year-old she-camels are due, and for 91-120 camels, two 3-year-old she-camels are due. When the number of camels is above 120 the zakat payable is one two-year-old she-camel for every 40 camels or one three-year-old she-camel for every 50.
                        
                        
                        For cows: A one-year-old cow is due for 30-39 cows, and a two-year-old one is due for 40 cows. When the number of cows is greater, the zakat due is calculated by multiples of these figures: a one-year-old cow for every 30, and a two-year-old cow for every 40.
                        
                        
                        For sheep: For 40-120 sheep, one sheep is due in zakat; and for 121-200, two sheep become due. For 201-300, three sheep are due. Then one sheep is due in zakat for every one hundred sheep above 300. hadith detailing these is reported by Anas who quotes the Prophet (peace be upon him): ‘For free grazing sheep, one sheep is due for 40, up to 120 sheep, when they are above 120 then two sheep are due until they reach 200. If they are more than 200, and up to 300, three sheep are due. Above 300, a sheep is due for every one hundred.’
                        
                        
                        Which animal to give in zakat
                        
                        
                        Islam requires that what is given in zakat should be of the average quality of the flock or herd owned by a person, and not be of the highest or lowest quality. In animals, the age is very important. An animal that is younger than what is specified is insufficient and deprives the poor of some of what is due to them, and one that is older may be an unfair loss to the owner.
                        
                        The zakat officer must not take an animal which is ill, defective or old because it does not benefit the poor. On the other hand, he should not take a fat animal that is intended for food, or a pregnant one, or the one that is looking after its calf, or the ram prepared for breeding, or the best looking animal. To take any of these is to be unjust to the owner.The Prophet (peace be upon him) told one of his Companions he sent to collect zakat:
                        
                        
                        ‘Do not touch their best property’

                        Mixing cattle
                        
                        This is done in two ways: mixing individual animals, when the flock is owned by two people, without separating them so as to know which belongs to whom. This happens either through inheritance or through purchase. The other way is mixing by appearance, which means that what belongs to each owner is known, but they are neighbours.
                        
                        Both ways make the two properties as one. If the total is equal to or above the threshold of zakat, then both owners are liable to zakat. However, if one of them is a non-Muslim, the mixing does not apply. The two properties should share the same pen or sheepfold, grazing area, milking place and have the same stallions. When these conditions are met, the two properties are treated as one.
                        
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
                        ‘What is separate should not be joined together, and what is joined should not be separated to evade zakat. The two owners of a mixed flock divide what is due equally between them’
                        
                        Related by al-Bukhari, hadith No. 1,450
                         Mixing may make zakat payable or may waive it altogether. This is applicable to zakat on cattle only.
                        
                        It is sinful to mix animals in order to dodge zakat. An example of joining the separate properties is the case of three people who each have 40 sheep, making 120 in total. If each of them is to pay his own zakat, each will give one sheep, while if they join their properties together, the zakat due on them all is one sheep. Thus, joining the separated flocks makes the zakat due one sheep instead of three and this is prohibited if it were to avoid zakat.
                        
                        An opposite case is that of two men having 40 sheep. When they are aware of the approach of the zakat officer, they separate their sheep, keeping 20 in one place and 20 in another. Neither flock becomes liable to zakat. This is also prohibited as they are trying to trick Allah to skip paying zakat.

                        name: 'Zakat al-Fitr',
                        content: `Zakat al- fitr is due after the month of Ramadan is over. Each Muslim must pay it on his behalf and for those whom he is duty bound to support. How it is paid, to whom, the amount and the time are all explained below.

                        This zakat is given its name because it becomes due when the month of Ramadan is over. It is not levied on property, but on heads and people. [1]
                        
                        Ruling: Zakat al-Fitr is a duty incumbent on every Muslim. Ibn 'Umar reports: ‘Allah’s messenger made the Zakat al-Fitr, a sa' [2] of dates or barley, binding on every Muslim: slave or free, male or female, young or old.”[3]
                        
                        
                        Conditions: Zakat al-Fitr is a duty that applies to all Muslims, whether they are young or old, male or female, as clearly stated in the hadith quoted above. It is also recommended to be paid for the unborn embryo if the pregnancy is past four months. People in the early period of Islam used to do so, as authentically reported to have been done by 'Uthman and others.
                        
                        
                        Every Muslim must pay it on his own behalf and on behalf of those whom he is duty bound to support, such as his wife and offspring. In the days of slavery, a master had to pay it for his slave. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ‘No zakat is payable on slaves except the Zakat al-Fitr.’[4] As a duty, Zakat al-Fitr applies to everyone who has more than what he needs for his food and the food of his dependants for the day and the night of the Eid. If one has in excess of that, which is enough to pay this zakat, then one must pay it.[5] This means that there are two conditions for this zakat to be payable: 1) Islam. It is not paid by non-Muslims; and 2) having more than one needs for his essential needs for the day and night of the Eid.
                        
                        
                        Purpose: Zakat al-Fitr is made a duty as a condition to ensure a number of great benefits,[6] such as:
                        
                        1-It is a spiritual purification for the person who has completed the fasting in Ramadan. He might have slipped on occasions, committing some unintended errors.
                        
                        2-It enables the poor and the needy to enjoy the Eid without having to ask anyone for food. They share the delight that the Eid brings to all people in the community. Ibn 'Abbas said: ‘Allah’s messenger stipulated Zakat al-Fitr as purification for the fasting person from any frivolous talk or obscenity and as a food for the needy.’[7]
                        
                        3-It is a demonstration of gratitude to Allah for enabling us to fast during the month of Ramadan and to offer night worship and do other good works in a totally blessed month.
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        What and how much
                        
                        The amount due is four times the fill of a man’s cupped hands of wheat, barley, dates, raisins, dried yogurt, rice, corn, etc. which should be a staple food of one’s community. This is well established in a number of authentic hadiths, such as the one quoted above by Ibn 'Umar. A group of people may give their Zakat al-Fitr to one person, and one person may give his to a group.
                        
                        
                        Payment of the price of the food is not an appropriate alternative to giving the food itself, because paying the price is contrary to what the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered and to the practice of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) Companions. They used to pay it in kind. Moreover, Zakat al-Fitr is an act of worship required to be fulfilled with food, and it is wrong to give it in any different form.[8]
                        
                        This is the view of Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ibn Hazm and others. The Hanafi school of Fiqh and al-Thawri say that it is appropriate to pay the price of the same quantity of food. This is also reported to be the view of 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz and al-Hasan al-Basri.
                        
                        
                        The scholars have discussed this point at length, Though ‘the permissibility of paying Zakat al-Fitr in value, rather than in kind, is indicated in the hadith that quotes the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Make them [i.e. the poor] self-sufficient on this day”, and this is fulfilled by paying the value as well as by giving food. it is best if possible to follow the Sunnah exactly by giving it as food. While this is easier and more feasible in our present time, particularly in industrial areas where people conduct all their transactions in money, the issue is not one of convenience. In many modern societies, the giving of wheat or dates may not be welcomed as this is not the staple used in their home. It appearsthat the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated that Zakat al-Fitr is paid in food for two reasons: 1) money was scarce among the Arabs at the time, which made it easier to give their zakat in kind; and 2) the purchase power of money differs from time to time, while a quantity of food meets a certain human need. During the Prophet’s time, food was easier to give and better for the person in need. If we can do the same without worrying that the food will be unwelcome or otherwise not useful for the person in question, that is certainly best. If we have doubts though, and find that the money will be more useful and welcome to the poor person, there should be no harm in giving it in value rather than in kind’[9]
                        
                        
                        Some scholars of the Hanafi school of Fiqh say that it is better to give Zakat al-Fitr in kind at all times, because this complies with the Sunnah. Others give more details, saying that in times of hardship and scarcity of food it is better to pay this zakat in kind, but in times of plenty, paying it in money is better because it is more helpful to the poor.
                        
                        
                        Time
                        
                        
                        Zakat al-Fitr becomes due when the sun has set on the last day of Ramadan, because this is what signals the end of the fast. The time to pay it is divided into two parts: the preferable one and the acceptable one. The preferable time is from the break of dawn on the Eid day until shortly before the Eid prayer. This is based on the hadith reported by Ibn 'Umar: ‘The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that the Zakat al-Fitr should be paid out before people go out to offer the Eid prayer.’[10] The acceptable time is one or two days before the Eid, as Ibn 'Umar and other Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) did that.
                        
                        
                        It may not be delayed until after the Eid prayer has been offered. If it is so delayed, it counts as an ordinary charity, and the person delaying payment is deemed to have committed an offence. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ‘For whoever pays it before the prayer, it is well and accepted, and for the one who pays it after the prayer, it counts as an ordinary charity.’[11] This type of zakat must be given only to the poor and needy.
                        
                        
                        The beneficiaries of zakat
                        
                        Zakat is payable only to those who may benefit by it. These are the eight classes named in the following verse:
                        
                        ‘Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy, and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.’
                        
                        (9:60)
                        
                        To give more details about these classes:[12]
                        
                        1-The poor: A poor person is one who does not have enough to meet his and his dependants’ needs of food, drink, clothes and home. He may have nothing, or may not have enough. He is given what meets his needs for a full year.
                        
                        2-The needy: A needy person is one who gets half what he needs for living, or even more than half. He is given out of zakat funds what he needs for a year.
                        
                        3- Administrative workers: This refers to anyone assigned by the Muslim ruler to collect zakat. The ruler gives him what he needs during his travel until he returns, even though he may be rich. This is because such a person devotes his time to this work. The administrative workers include all those who are given the tasks of collecting, recording, safeguarding and distribution of zakat to its rightful beneficiaries.
                        
                        This certainly applied when Muslim governments undertook the collection and distribution of zakat, however, in modern times most, if not all, Muslim governments have abandoned this duty. However, there are many civil and charitable organizations which have taken on this responsibility and undertake this duty. These may deduct from what they collect of zakat money to pay to their staff, who are employed for this task. However, they may not pay zakat money except for their work in the administration of zakat. If a member of staff works only half of his working hours on zakat duties, while the other half is devoted to other aspects of his employment, he may be paid only half his salary out of zakat funds.
                        
                        4-Those whose hearts are to be won over: These are people who may be unbelievers and they are given money out of zakat to win their goodwill towards Islam, or they may be Muslims but not very strong in faith, or they are people who have non-Muslim relatives who need to be encouraged to look favourably at Islam, or whose help is needed, etc.
                        
                        5-The freeing of people in bondage: This refers to Muslim slaves who may be bought to give them their freedom. Their price may be paid out of zakat funds. Alternatively, a slave might have agreed a deal to buy his own freedom, and he or she is given what helps them to complete the deal and buy their freedom. This enables slaves to be good members of society, able to conduct their own affairs and to serve Allah’s cause as best as they can. The same applies to pay ransom to free Muslim captives taken by the enemy.
                        
                        6- Debtors: This applies to a person who has incurred a debt for a legitimate purpose, whether it is for personal reasons or to help others. Debtors are given from the zakat funds what helps them to repay their debts. If someone incurred a debt to pay for the reconciliation of quarrelling parties, he is helped with zakat funds, even though he may be wealthy.
                        
                        7- To further Allah’s cause: This applies to fighters for Allah’s cause who volunteer to join the Muslim army and they have no salary. They are given money from zakat, even though they may not be in need.
                        
                        8- The traveller in need: This refers to a traveller who is unable to continue his journey to his place of residence. He may not be able to borrow what he needs, so he is given from zakat what he needs for his journey home.

                        id: 1,
                        name: 'The transfer of zakat to a different town',
                        content: `Zakat is payable for the poor and needy wherever they are. It is permissible to transfer zakat to another town. It is also encouraged to pay it to poor relatives as it gives one the advantage of kindness to relatives.

                        It is permissible to transfer zakat from the town of the payer to a near or distant town when this is needed. The distant town may be poorer than the town where the payer lives, or he may have poor relatives in a distant place. To pay one’s zakat to one’s relatives gives one the advantage of kindness to relatives, which is strongly encouraged by Islam. This is the correct view, because the verse defining the eight classes of beneficiaries is general in its import:
                        
                        ‘Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and  for the needy.... ’ (9:60)
